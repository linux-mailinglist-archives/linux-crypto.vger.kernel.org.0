I also just haven't submitted much in the past year, taking a bit of a
break to see how things would settle. Seemed like rushing things
wasn't prudent, so I slowed down.

No, this is not a matter of munition at all. Please take my words
seriously; I am entirely genuine here. Three people I greatly respect
made a very compelling argument to me, prompting the decision in [1].
The argument was that trying to fix the crypto layer AND trying to get
WireGuard merged at the same time was ambitious and crazy. Maybe
instead, they argued, I should just use the old crypto API, get
WireGuard in, and then begin the Zinc process after. I think
procedurally, that's probably good advice, and the people I was
talking to seemed to have a really firm grasp on what works and what
doesn't in the mainlining process. Now it's possible their judgement
is wrong, but I really am open, in earnest, to following it. And the
way that would look would be not trying to fix the crypto API now,
getting WireGuard in based on whatever we can cobble together based on
the current foundations with some intermediate file (cryptoapi.c in my
previous email) to prevent it from infecting WireGuard. This isn't
"munition"; it's a serious proposal.

The funny thing, though, is that all the while I was under the
impression somebody had figured out a great way to do this, it turns
out you were busy with basically Zinc-but-not. So we're back to square
one: you and I both want the crypto API to change, and now we have to
figure out a way forward together on how to do this, prompting my last
email to you, indicating that I was open to all sorts of compromises.
However, I still remain fully open to following the prior suggestion,
of not doing that at all right now, and instead basing this on the
existing crypto API as-is.

Good. I'm happy to learn that you're all for having fast
implementations that underlie the simple function calls.

Deployed at scale, the handshake must have a certain performance to
not be DoS'd. I've spent a long time benching these and attacking my
own code.  I won't be comfortable with this going in without the fast
implementations for the handshake. And down the line, too, we can look
into how to even improve the DoS resistance. I think there's room for
improvement, and I hope at some point you'll join us in discussions on
WireGuard internals. But the bottom line is that we need those fast
primitives.

As I was saying, this is indeed the case.

I'm not being disingenuous. DoS resistance is a real issue with
WireGuard. You might argue that FourQ and Siphash would have made
better choices, and that's an interesting discussion, but it is what
it is. The thing needs fast implementations. And we're going to have
to implement that code anyway for other things, so might as well get
it working well now.

You're not required to use WireGuard.

That's good to know. It doesn't fully address the issue, though.

That'd be a major improvement to the async interface, yes.

For a first version of WireGuard, no, I'm really not interested in
that. Adding it in there is more ambitious than it looks to get it
right. Async means more buffers, which means the queuing system for
WireGuard needs to be changed. There's already ongoing research into
this, and I'm happy to consider that research with a light toward
maybe having async stuff in the future. But sticking into the code now
as-is simply does not work from a buffering/queueing perspective. So
again, let's take an iterative approach here: first we do stuff with
the simple synchronous API. After the dust has settled, hardware is
available for testing, Van Jacobson has been taken off the bookshelf
for a fresh reading, and we've all sat down for a few interesting
conversations at netdev on queueing and bufferbloat, then let's start
working this in. In otherwords, just because technically you can glue
those APIs together, sort of, doesn't mean that approach makes sense
for the system as a whole.

We need the accelerated implementations. And we'll need it for chapoly
too, obviously. So let's work out a good way to hook that all into the
Zinc-style interface. [2] does it in a very effective way that's
overall quite good for performance and easy to follow. The
chacha20-x86_64-glue.c code itself gets called via the static symbol
chacha20_arch. This is implemented for each platform with a fall back
to one that returns false, so that the generic code is called. The
Zinc stuff here is obvious, simple, and I'm pretty sure you know
what's up with it.

I prefer each of these glue implementations to live in
lib/zinc/chacha20/chacha20-${ARCH}-glue.c. You don't like that and
want things in arch/${ARCH}/crypto/chacha20-glue.c. Okay, sure, fine,
let's do all the naming and organization and political stuff how you
like, and I'll leave aside my arguments about why I disagree. Let's
take stock of where that leaves us, in terms of files:

- lib/crypto/chacha20.c: this has a generic implementation, but at the
top of the generic implementation, it has some code like "if
(chacha20_arch(..., ..., ...)) return;"
- arch/crypto/x86_64/chacha20-glue.c: this has the chacha20_arch()
implementation, which branches out to the various SIMD implementations
depending on some booleans calculated at module load time.
- arch/crypto/arm/chacha20-glue.c: this has the chacha20_arch()
implementation, which branches out to the various SIMD implementations
depending on some booleans calculated at module load time.
- arch/crypto/mips/chacha20-glue.c: this has the chacha20_arch()
implementation, which contains an assembly version that's always run
unconditionally.

Our goals are that chacha20_arch() from each of these arch glues gets
included in the lib/crypto/chacha20.c compilation unit. The reason why
we want it in its own unit is so that the inliner can get rid of
unreached code and more tightly integrate the branches. For the MIPS
case, the advantage is clear. Here's how Zinc handles it: [3]. Some
simple ifdefs and includes. Easy and straightforward. Some people
might object, though, and it sounds like you might. So let's talk
about some alternative mechanisms with their pros and cons:

- The zinc method: straightforward, but not everybody likes ifdefs.
- Stick the filename to be included into a Kconfig variable and let
the configuration system do the logic: also straightforward. Not sure
it's kosher, but it would work.
- Weak symbols: we don't get inlining or the dead code elimination.
- Function pointers: ditto, plus spectre.
- Other ideas you might have? I'm open to suggestions here.

I wouldn't worry so much about that. Zinc/library-based-crypto is just
trying to fulfill the boring synchronous pure-code part of crypto
implementations. For the async stuff, we can work together on
improving the existing crypto API to be more appealing, in tandem with
some interesting research into packet queuing systems. From the other
thread, you might have seen that already Toke has cool ideas that I
hope we can all sit down and talk about. I'm certainly not interested
in "bolting" anything on to Zinc/library-based-crypto, and I'm happy
to work to improve the asynchronous API for doing asynchronous crypto.
