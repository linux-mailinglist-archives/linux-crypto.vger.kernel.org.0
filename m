Thank you for sharing your considerations.

If you say that only one implementation should be there, I am wondering why 
not considering an implementation that as significant advantages over the 
existing implementation as outlined in my cover letter to patch v35. In the 
default configuration, it compiles no code at all that has any bearing on 
government standards. Yet it has a more cryptographic sound approach to handle 
entropy. In addition is meant to be extensible allowing each user to pick and 
chose what he wants. Yet, users who do not want these extensions should not 
suffer from it (neither performance-wise, nor should they suffer from an 
unnecessary complex code that builds all options into one C file).

And speaking of fragmentation, if it is not *possible* to allow users to pick 
what they want and need (and yes, in some parts of the world or for some users 
these government standards are simply a necessity), we surely invite 
fragmentation. In the LRNG, I tried to have all operations critical to entropy 
compression and random number generation modularized so that the a can be 
replaced or extended if needed without fragmentation.

PS: The reason why I started the LRNG was not government standards, but the 
result of performing two studies. The one study was about entropy in 
virtualized environment which showed that we have significant entropy in 
virtual environments and yet the existing /dev/random implementation thinks 
there is much less available. Another study I maintain for years also shows 
that the entire entropy collection and heuristic on bare metal systems is also 
in need of advancements. Initially I provided patches to the existing /dev/
random implementation, but basically all were silently ignored.

Ciao
Stephan
