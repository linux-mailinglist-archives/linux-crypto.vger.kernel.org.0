Right, at which point you have to consider what happens with=20
interleaving allocates and deallocates. I'm not saying it's wrong, just=20
that if you do credential allocation, hcall allocation, irq allocation,=20
and list insertion all under the one lock, and remoe it all under the=20
one lock, concurrency requires less attention.

That's okay you can use mutexes for that too if that's how you're
protecting them.

It definitely could if you have a lot of concurrent open/close, but
the code as is won't handle it all that well either, so there's the
question of what is reasonable to do and what is reasonable to add
concurrency complexity for.

As I said, you've got it working and seem to have covered all cases now=20
so let's get the series in first. But something to consider changing
IMO.

Thanks,
Nick
