Sure, AF_ALG users could expect ciphertext stealing to work.  I don't know of
any actual examples of people saying they want it, but it's possible.

My point is simply that we add this, we need to find a way to support it in all
implementations.  It's not helpful to add it to only one specific driver, as
then it's inconsistent and is untestable with the common tests.
