I understand that. But even if the application is synchronous, it does
not mean that the whole world stops and nothing is using the
accelerator in the mean time.

Of course. And so do we. And that is why we meet in the middle to compromise.

If the algorithm in question is defined for zero length inputs, but
the h/w chooses not to implement that case, I think non-compliant is a
rather nice way to say 'broken'. I know there is a gradient here going
from hashes, AEADs to symmetric ciphers, but I think this applies to
all of them.

From a software point of view, adding special cases for zero length
inputs amounts to what you are trying to avoid: using more 'silicon
area'.

Proper validation requires coverage based testing, i.e., that all
statements in a program can be proven to be exercised by some use
case, and produce the correct result.

This means that, if we have to add 'if (message_length > 0) { do this;
} else { do that; }' everywhere, we are moving the effort from your
corner to mine. Of course I am going to oppose to that :-)

While software implementations can sometimes be fixed quickly,
software APIs have *really* long lifetimes as well, especially in the
server space. And until you have reached sufficient coverage with your
updated API, you are stuck with both the old one and the new one, so
you have even more code to worry about.

So a crypto API where zero length inputs are not permitted or treated
specially is not the way to fix this.

I think the bottom line is still to fix the driver and be done with
it. I honestly don't care about what exactly your h/w supports, as
long as the driver that encapsulates it addresses the impedance
mismatch between what the h/w layer provides and what the upper layer
expects.
