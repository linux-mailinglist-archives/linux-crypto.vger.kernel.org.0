Extract_buf() is supposed to be able to reliably generate high quality
randomness; that's why we use it for the chacha reseed.  If
extract_buf() can return return the same value for two parallel calls
to extract_buf(), that's a Bad Thing.  For example, suppose there were
two chacha contexts reseeding using extract_buf(), and they were
racing against each other on two different CPU's.  Having two of them
reseed with the same value would be a cryptographic weakness.

NACK to both patches.
