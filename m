First, thank you for taking the extra step here. Does "reserved for HAB"
mean TF-A is using it or is the BootROM already using it. TF-A is
optional (so is HAB I guess?). So it might be possible to have jr0 in 
linux,
right? If that is correct, the solution to disable the jr0 at compile 
time
is wrong.

Thus it has to be done at run time. Either by removing/disabling the 
node
in u-boot or by not probing it. I'm not sure whats the correct solution
here, though.

If you clean up later, probably most of this code is going away, no?
Then whats the point in having this patch in the first place. Usually
its the other way around.

Having the total_jobrs (and using it for anything else than messages)
static will create an unnecessary dependency on the correct probe
order.

For now the LS1028A has 4.

Ahh I didn't notice that the register was part of the parent. Meh.

I see. But we should really communicate whether the child should
return ENODEV in a different way. IMHO this static thing is really
fragile.

Probably, but that would also mean we'd have to distiguish
between these too. You're checking PRIM_TZ which is SDID
on the LS1028A (which is an arbitrary number if I understand
it correctly). So the check above might actually trigger although
it shouldn't.

That said, whats PRIM_TZ? When is it set?

probably, but as said above, we'd then need to distiguish
between both. If you need to check PRIM_TZ which I haven't
fully understood for now.
