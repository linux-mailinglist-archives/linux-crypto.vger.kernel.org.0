Doesn't getrandom() already basically have this quality? If you call
getrandom(0), it'll block until the RNG is initialized once (which now
happens pretty reliably early on in boot). If you call getrandom(GRND_
INSECURE), it will skip that blocking. Both mechanisms are reliable and
available on all current kernel.org stable kernels.

Is there something about these you don't like and think need fixing? I'm
open to suggestions on how to further improve that interface if it has a
notable shortcoming.

If somebody has a compelling performance case that's widespread and
can't be fixed in the kernel alone, I wouldn't be adverse to vDSOing it.
But such an undertaking would probably be contingent on doing this with
the glibc developers, rather than trying to retroactively bandaid an
addition that shipped broken with a documentation cop-out.

Jason
