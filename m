We have to do a 128bit atomic write here to trigger a mailbox. The reason is
that one QM hardware entity in one accelerator servers QM mailbox MMIO interfaces in
related PF and VFs.

A mutex can not lock different processing flows in different functions.

As Arnd mentioned, v8.4 extends the support for 16 bytes atomic stp to some kinds of
normal memory, but for device memory, it is still implementation defined. For this
SoC(Kunpeng920) which has QM/ZIP, if the address is 128bit aligned, stp will be atomic.
The offset of QM mailbox is 128bit aligned, so it is safe here.

Best,
Zhou
