Sure.  I was just too lazy to actually set the -1 everywhere.  I'll
try to do that before I repost again.

I don't think we should support chaining for XTS at all so I don't
see why we need to worry about the hardware accelerated XTS code.

As I said we need to be able to differentiate between the ones
that can chain vs. the ones that can't.  Putting this knowledge
directly into algif_skcipher is just too horrid.

The alternative is to add this marker into the algorithms.  My
point was that if you're going to do that you might as well go
a step further and allow cts to chain as it is so straightforward.

Cheers,
