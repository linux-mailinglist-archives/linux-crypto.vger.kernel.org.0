My memory is a bit fuzzy here. I remember talking to the linux-rt guys
about what delay is actually acceptable, which was a lot higher than I
had thought based on their initial reports about scheduling blackouts
on arm64 due to preemption remaining disabled for too long. I intended
to revisit this with more accurate bounds but then I apparently
forgot.

So SIMD chacha20 and SIMD poly1305 both run in <5 cycles per bytes,
both on x86 and ARM. If we take 20 microseconds as a ballpark upper
bound for how long preemption may be disabled, that gives us ~4000
bytes of ChaCha20 or Poly1305 on a hypothetical 1 GHz core.

So I think 4 KB is indeed a reasonable quantum of work here. Only
PAGE_SIZE is not necessarily equal to 4 KB on arm64, so we should use
SZ_4K instead.

*However*, at the time, the report was triggered by the fact that we
were keeping SIMD enabled across calls into the scatterwalk API, which
may call kmalloc()/kfree() etc. There is no need for that anymore, now
that the FPU begin/end routines all have been optimized to restore the
userland SIMD state lazily.

So do we have any callers that are likely to pass more than 4 KB of
input at a time? AF_ALG perhaps? Is this code path covered by the
tcrypt tests? Even if we all agree that this chunking is probably
needed, I'd still like us to have an idea of when/how it is likely to
get exercised.
