The "backup plan" would be to sleep-loop-read /proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail
until it passes a certain threshold one time. This might also work on even older
kernels than the poll() trick. But that's pretty darn ugly, so it's not
obvious to me where the cut-off in frustration is, when we throw our
hands up and decide the ugliness is worth it compared to whatever
problems we happen to be facing at the time with the poll() technique.
But at least there is an alternative, should we need it.
