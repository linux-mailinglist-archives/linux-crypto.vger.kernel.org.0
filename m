We've asked our certification lab whether they'd approve the tcrypt
testing, but they say they are concerned that the test would run too
late and it won't exactly match the NIAP requirements.

If you could provide an example of some validation that folks from the
ecosystem did successfully with tcrypt, then I might be able to point
the lab to their CMVP certificate (like
https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/certificate/3753),
and maybe that'd make them happy with Android using tcrypt...

Yeah, that's what I was intending to utilize in my patch: I just
reduced the number of crypto modules to which the self-tests should
apply, to avoid testing ones that aren't essential to certification.

Well, as I mentioned above, the certification lab is concerned about
invoking tcrypt for testing because user-space controls it and "it's
too late". And the testmgr, when fully enabled, introduces a big
enough boot time increase for our Android team to shout at me angrily
:) So I decided to go with "testmgr but partial".


Cheers,
Elena
