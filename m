This patch seems to be repeating the same mistake I just cleaned up.
Specifically, an advantage of a CPU RNG is that it can always provide
*fresh* entropy, so that if, say, the system state is dumped, the CPU
will continue to provide fresh new uncompromised values. When you buffer
those values, they cease to be fresh.

But more realistically, have you benchmarked this and seen that it's
actually required? These functions are called once at boot, and then
when the RNG is reseeded, which happens around once a minute. That's
pretty darn rare. When you consider all the cycles that are completed
over the course of a minute, whatever the cost of the TRNG is seems
pretty negligible.

So anyway, maybe it'd be best to look at the "big picture" problem you
want to solve, rather than what looks to me like an attempt to solve a
problem that doesn't exist. Or maybe it does? If so, I'd be interested
to know when and how and where and such.

Jason
