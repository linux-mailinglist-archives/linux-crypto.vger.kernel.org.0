Thanks for your review. To me it seems like ecc_gen_privkey is 
externally accessible, and could therefore be considered a 
general-purpose function. However, you are right that it is currently 
only used in the kernel for ECDH key pair generation, which falls under 
SP 800-56Ar3. Perhaps that would be a more suitable reference, but I did 
not want to make any drastic changes to the documentation.

Moreover, the procedure described in SP 800-56Ar3 (Section 5.6.1.2.2) is 
functionally equivalent to the procedure from FIPS 186-5. This is also 
supported by the fact that NIST's Cryptographic Algorithm Validation 
Program (CAVP) does not have a separate test for EC key pair generation 
from SP 800-56Ar3. Instead, the test for ECDSA key pair generation is 
re-used (see e.g. 
https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-algorithm-validation-program/details?validation=36423).

In any case, compliance with FIPS 186-5 or SP 800-56Ar3 would require n 
 >= 224, as you pointed out.
