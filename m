I've also taken a look at the standard text. The majority of it is the 
SDF API definition which is in C and with all identifiers in English, so 
even non-speakers of Chinese can probably understand much of it.

But I tend to agree that the SDF API is abstract enough that it does not 
matter whether it's directly exposed by kernel UAPI or not; while I'm 
not familiar with the Linux crypto subsystem either, it seems entirely 
appropriate for the kernel driver to expose the standard crypto API, and 
for the SDF API to reside in a user-space shim. This way we could have 
non-SDF-aware applications transparently make use of the Loongson HW 
capability, and also have non-Loongson crypto HW available through the 
same SDF interface (should some board designer choose to do so).
