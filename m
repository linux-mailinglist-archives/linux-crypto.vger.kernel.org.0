That's basically what I suggested in the cover letter:

"As future work, we should split sha.h into sha1.h and sha2.h and try to
remove the remaining uses of SHA-1.  For example, the remaining use in
drivers/char/random.c is probably one that can be gotten rid of."

("sha2.h" rather than "sha256.h", since it would include SHA-512 too.
Also, we already have sha3.h, so having sha{1,2,3}.h would be logical.)

But there are 108 files that include <crypto/sha.h>, all of which would need to
be updated, which risks merge conflicts.  So this series seemed like a good
stopping point to get these initial changes in for 5.8.  Then in the next
release we can split up sha.h (and debate whether sha1.h should really be
"<crypto/dangerous/sha1.h>" or whatever).

There are 3 files where I added an include of sha.h, where we could go directly
to sha1.h if we did it now.  But that's not much compared to the 108 files.
