I sent a workaround to disable UBSAN_UNSIGNED_OVERFLOW an
x86-32, after showing that this did not affect arm32, arm64 or x86-64:
27c287b41659 ("ubsan: disable unsigned-overflow check for i386")

As the report is for ppc64, it appears that this is not just specific to x86-32
after all. I have had no success in isolating the problem in clang, but I
did not try too hard either. I see this .config also enables
CONFIG_UBSAN_UNSIGNED_OVERFLOW=y, so it would be a
reasonable assumption that this is the same problem as on x86-32.

There is also another thread on CONFIG_UBSAN_UNSIGNED_OVERFLOW
causing BUILD_BUG_ON() failures.
