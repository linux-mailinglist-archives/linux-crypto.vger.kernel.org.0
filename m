Yes, properly formed packets will probably require some procedural support.
I can't say right away which exactly extension mechanism in syzkaller
is the best for this.
But there is another one I forgot to mention - custom pseudo syscalls.
For the generic fuzzer engine they look like normal syscalls that
accept/return something:
https://github.com/google/syzkaller/blob/36650b4b2c942bc382314dce384d311fbadd1208/sys/linux/vnet.txt#L26
but the actual implementation is our custom C code that can do
anything (augment data, form packets, call multiple syscalls, take
result of one syscall, do something with it and use as argument for
another, etc):
https://github.com/google/syzkaller/blob/36650b4b2c942bc382314dce384d311fbadd1208/executor/common_linux.h#L972-L1023
These make doing a complex thing trivial for fuzzer, but the more is
hardcoded there, the less randomness we get from fuzzing (though that
presudo-syscall can also accept some additional randomness and use it
in some way).

Yes, there is this location to pre-create some net devices in right states:
https://github.com/google/syzkaller/blob/79b211f74b08737aeb4934c6ff69a263b3c38013/executor/common_linux.h#L668
(not in Go, but in C because eventually it will become part of C reproducers).
For example it creates vcan0 device and then syscall descriptions know
this name and use it.
