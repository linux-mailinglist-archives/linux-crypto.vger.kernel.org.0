But it is not a limitation. You are arguing that it is natural and
obvious to cast the expression, but it is not. Really.

(be32)lvalue = <expression of type be32>

would actually mean that the operation applied to the expression is
the opposite, given the lvalue is *not* a be32 to begin with, and so
you expect that lvalue is made to be a be32 for the purpose of the
assignment, after which it is converted back to what it was before? In
this particular case, this comes down to doing the inverse cast on the
expression. But what happens is there is no inverse cast? What would
it mean, for instance, to do

(u16)lvalue = <expression of type s16>

when lvalue is of type s16 itself? Does the sign bit become a data bit
now? Do we have to keep track of this throughout the code?

The bottom line is that the cast operation is only defined for values,
not for variables. A variable's type is fixed - you cannot change it
for the duration of a cast operation and expect the compiler to infer
what this might mean in the general case, even if you think your
endianness conversion example is an obvious case.

That is not what I said.

I said that an abstract API that reasons about unspecified algorithms
taking inputs and output of an unspecified nature, using keys of an
unspecified nature should not be expected to define how such
unspecified quantities are organized if they happen to be interpreted
as multi-byte words by some of its implementations.

That doesn't make it the job of the abstraction that is layered on top
to define it.

Yes, so for the shash implementations of "crc32" and "crc32c", it is
defined by the implementation. But that doesn't mean shash should
specify that this is the case for all algorithms.

I am not saying it is hard. I am saying it is wrong. The skcipher
API's job is not to fill holes in the algorithm's specification.
