I do not fully agree. If this is comparable to configuring h/w
registers, then you could probably have defines explaining why each bit
is set and what it's doing. Which would be fine.

Right. The main difference here is we do have a clear definition of what
the tokens are doing. Thanks to your explanation, if this firmware is
really looking like the token we're using, the words have a defined
structure and the magic values could be generated with proper defines
and macros. And I think it's the main issue here: it's not acceptable to
have an array of magic values. If you can give a meaning to those bits,
I see no reason why it couldn't be added to the driver.

(And I'm all for what you're trying to achieve here :)).

Given your explanation, I agree. (If those bits can have meaning).

Thanks!
