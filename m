As I already mentioned in another thread somewhere, this morning in the
shower I realised that this may be useful if you have no expectation of
the length itself. But it's still a pretty specific use case which was
never considered for our hardware. And our HW doesn't seem to be alone in
this.
Does shaXXXsum or md5sum use the kernel crypto API though?

Oh, it's defined all right. I never argued that it wasn't.
But just because the *algorithm* allows it doesn't necessarily mean that yo=
u
*have* to support it from your API. Even FIPS allows for not supporting zer=
o
length for validation - zero length support is optional there.

And I'm just not aware of any real use case - usually some standard non-zer=
o
header is included as AAD - so why bother going out of your way to support =
it.
If something fails because of this, you can always fix it right there and t=
hen.

I want to bet the people having to implement all these workarounds and fixe=

in those drivers would argue that it's not so straightforward at all ...

That goes without saying.
