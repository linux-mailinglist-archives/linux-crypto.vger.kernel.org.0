This regression was already fixed upstream by commit 366284cfbc8f
("KEYS: trusted_tpm1: Use SHA-1 library instead of crypto_shash").
It could be backported to 6.17 if needed.

Of course, the reason it fixed the regression is that it implicitly
dropped the broken and untested fips_enabled check.

Which is clearly the correct choice for now.

But for future reference, if the people doing FIPS certifications of the
whole kernel actually determine that a particular kernel feature(s) that
use SHA-1 *must* be disabled when fips_enabled=1, then of course they'll
need to do that properly by submitting a tested and well-justified patch
for each feature that carefully disables the correct functionality.

Submitting a broken, untested, and incomplete patch that makes the
kernel fail to boot and dm-crypt.ko fail to load isn't a great strategy.
