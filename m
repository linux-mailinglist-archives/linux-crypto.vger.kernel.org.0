md4 and md5 are used with the NTLMSSP authentication for all dialects,
including the latest 3.1.1.
The only other authentication mechanism for SMB is krb5.

This means that if we build a kernel without md4/md5 then we can no
longer use NTLMSSP user/password
style authentication, only kerberos.
I guess that the use cases where a kernel without these algorithms are
present are ok with kerberos as the
only authentication mech.

Afaik arc4 is only used for signing in the smb1 case.

I think initially we just wanted to disable its use. If we want to
compile a kernel completely without arc4/md4/md5 I think we would need
to:

1, Change CONFIG_CIFS_ALLOW_INSECURE_LEGACY=n to compile out the code
as you suggests.
This should remove the dependency for arc4. I think this would be a
good thing to do.

2, Have a different CONFIG_... to compile out the use of NTLMSSP
authentication. This must be a different define
since md4/md5 are also used for non-legacy dialects.
And this should remove the dependency of md4/5.

For the latter, I guess we would need a global, i.e. not
cifs-specific, config option for this. I assume other users of
rc4/md4/md5
would also want this.
A new CONFIG_INSECURE_CRYPTO=n ?
