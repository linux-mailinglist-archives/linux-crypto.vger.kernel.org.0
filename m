"xts(aes)" is the cra_name for AES-XTS, while everything else (e.g.
"xts(ecb(aes-generic))", "xts-aes-aesni", "xts(ecb-aes-aesni)")
is a cra_driver_name for AES-XTS.

"xts(ecb(aes))" doesn't make sense, as it's neither the cra_name nor does it
name a specific implementation.

See create() in crypto/xts.c.  It allows the XTS template to be passed either
the string "aes", *or* a string which names an *implementation* of "ecb(aes)",
like "ecb(aes-generic)" or "ecb-aes-aesni".  In the first case it allocates
"ecb(aes)" so it gets the highest priority AES-ECB implementation.

So in both cases the XTS template uses AES-ECB via the skcipher API.
