While this is correct in principle, it has not been that way in the
past.  The change had nothing to do with the patch it came in on, and
breaks existing configs used by some distros.  BIG_KEYS happened to be
our motivation for flipping those from module to built in, but I have
no way of knowing what else might be in a similar situation.  Worse,
many users will never know it is happening.  We simply have some
scripts that warn loudly if a config value is flipped from what it was
set to in our prebuild files.

This looks correct, and would likely alleviate our initial problem,
but it doesn't mean nothing else is impacted. I would still be in
favor of my patch going in to revert the dropped prompts for 5.17, and
then we can audit everything else that has any type of dep on the
crypto libs in question and provide a patch to fix everything up
correctly.  I am happy to do that audit, but probably wouldn't get the
time to do so until rc2 or later.  I do not see how the dropped
prompts for these libs have anything to do with the "blake2s: include
as built-in" that brought them in.
