I think MAP_SHARED_VALIDATE was mostly about worrying about the API impact.

And I think it worked out so well that this is probably the first time
it has been brought up ever since ;)

That said, the *reason* for MAP_SHARED_VALIDATE is actually very
valid: we have historically just ignored any random flags in the
mmap() interfaces, and with shared mappings, that can be dangerous.

IOW, the real issue wasn't MAP_SHARED_VALIDATE itself, but introducing
*other* flags that affected maps that old kernels would ignore, and
then the worry was "now old kernels and new kernels work very
differently for this binary".

That's technically obviously true of any MAP_DROPPABLE thing too - old
kernels would happily just ignore it. I suspect that's more of a
feature than a mis-feature, but..

It doesn't sound like a bad model in general. I'm not entirely sure it
makes sense for something like "droppable", since that is a fairly
fundamental behavioral thing. Does it make sense to make something
undroppable when it can drop pages concurrently with that operation?

I mean, you can't switch MAP_SHARED around either.

The other bits already _do_ have madvise() things, and Jason added a
way to just do it all in one go.

> Good to hear that this is changing. (or it's just been an urban myth)

I don't know if that's an urban myth.  Some people are a *lot* more
risk-averse than I personally am. I want things to make sense, but I
also consider "this is fixable if it causes issues" to be a valid
argument.

So for example, who knows *what* garbage people pass off to mmap() as
an argument. That worry was why MAP_SHARED_VALIDATE happened.

But at the same time, does it make sense to complicate things because
of some theoretical worry? Giving random bits to mmap() sounds
unlikely to be a real issue to me, but maybe I'm being naive.

I do generally think that user mode programs can pretty much be
expected to do random things, but how do you even *create* a mmap
MAP_xyz flags field that has random high bits set?

Don't thank me.

They actually do make sense in a "what if I want to mprotect() the
stack, but I don't know what the stack range is since it's dynamic"
kind of sense, so I certainly don't hate them.

So they are not bad bits, but at the same time they are examples of
how there is a fuzzy line between MAP_xyz and PROT_xyz.

And sometimes the line is literally just "mprotect() only gets one of
them, but we want to pass in the other one, so we duplicate them as a
very very special case".
