Currently to generate an AEAD test vector the code just generates a "random"
plaintext and encrypts it with the generic implementation.

My plan is to extend the tests to also sometimes generate a "random" ciphertext
and try to decrypt it; and also sometimes try to decrypt a corrupted ciphertext.

But the problem is that that's not what's actually happening, right?  "authenc"
actually does the authentication (of uninitialized memory, in this case) before
it gets around to failing due to the cbc length restriction.

Anyway, I suggest sending the patch I suggested as 1 of 2 to avoid this case (so
your patch does not cause test failures), then this patch as 2 of 2.
