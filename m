It was an intentional change since actually no alignment is required for this.
It's an array of 32 bytes and the code loads 16 bytes starting from some byte
offset in the range 1...16, so it has to use movdqu anyway.

There's no problem with changing it back to 32, but I don't fully understand
what's going on here.  Where is it documented how alignment specifiers interact
with the section merging?  Also, there are already other mergeable sections in
the x86 crypto code with alignment smaller than their entity size, e.g.

	.rodata.cst16.aegis128_const
	.rodata.cst16.aegis128l_const
	.rodata.cst16.aegis256_const
	.rodata.cst16.morus640_const
	.rodata.cst256.K256

Do those need to be changed too?
