Thank you, I will follow these series, the interconnects on DMA BAM
series is slipped from my attention, however I am able to run QCE
without adding interconnects to DMA BAM on available to me hardware.

No, the shared v9 is complete, and I test it on top of the linux-next.

I'm able to successfully test QCE by running 'cryptsetup benchmark' on
RB5 hardware, the involvement of QCE and DMA BAM IPs can be checked
either by looking at bam_dma interrupt numbers from /proc/interrupts,
by adding qcrypto.dyndbg=+p into the kernel command line or by
registered algos and priorities found at /proc/crypto:

[    9.515729] qcrypto 1dfa000.crypto: Crypto device found, version 5.5.0

I will be glad to know your opinion about the technical difference
between our two different sm8250.dtsi changes, please find my queries
in the previous email.
