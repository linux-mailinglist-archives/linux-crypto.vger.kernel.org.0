So this is proprietary IP integrated with a proprietary ARMv8 
implementation, so there could be a tight coupling, the like of which 
Will mentioned in that thread, but I'm doubtful.

I'm looking at the electronically translated documentation on this HW, 
and it reads "The Mailbox operation performed by the CPU cannot be 
interleaved", and then tells that software should lock against 
concurrent accesses or alternatively use a 128-bit access. So it seems 
that the 128b op used is only to guarantee software is atomic.

Wang Zhou can confirm my understanding.

If true, I see that we seem to be already guaranteeing mutual exclusion 
in qm_mb(), in taking a mutex.

Thanks,
John
