Yes, I thought about using more TFMs, but I don't have access to the dual 
Xeon machine anymore (I would have to request access and wait until people 
who are using it release it).

We can run more tests, but it would be best to batch all the tests in a 
small timeframe, to minimize blocking the machine for other people.

Regarding synchronous submission - the current test submits 112 requests 
concurrently. Do you think that it is too small and we should submit more? 
What would be the appropriate number of requests to submit concurrently?

I did synchronous submission because it was easier to write it than 
asynchronous submission, but if you think that 112 requests is too small 
and we need to submit more, I can try to do it.
