Wouldn't it be easier to just implement ecb(aes) in your driver (using your
workaround to do it 1 block at a time using the hardware CBC engine)?  If you
implement ecb(aes), then the xts template can use it, so you wouldn't need to
implement xts(aes) directly.  And this would still avoid all the individual
calls to crypto_cipher_{encrypt,decrypt}, which I expect is the performance
bottleneck that you were seeing.
