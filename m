Hi Andrew,

I pushed to my GitHub repository the RNG dumps and NIST reports from the 
other 2 SOCs. The results are similar to the first SOC. None of the 
modes passed the NIST test for linear rank and approximate entropy. 
Also, these SOCs show that mode 6 produces better results than mode 7. 
However, having only a sample of 3 SOCs isn't going to give us 
statistical significance about which mode would be the best one on these 
SOCs but, it is hinting us that perhaps allowing the selection of other 
RNG modes would be a good feature to have in a driver.
Now, I must say that this is the first RO-based RNG that I have tested 
and I'm a bit concerned about the results I've been getting. I'm now 
wondering how RNGs from other SOC vendors would perform with this same 
test suite.

I decided to wrote the Aspeed-RNG driver because was under the 
impression that the community would prefer dedicated drivers over 
generic ones for these SOCs.  However, enhancing timeriomem-rng module 
is not hard at all.  As I matter of fact, I'm currently testing changes 
to timeriomem-rng and so far so good. If you would like to have a quick 
look to my changes, I just pushed patches to the same repo a couple of 
hours ago:

Thanks
Oscar
