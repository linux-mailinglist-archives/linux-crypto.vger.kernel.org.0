Gah, yes, you're right, there could be multiple ranges in a max order block, so
the threads have to use the zone iterators to skip the holes.

Agreed, it's not expensive, it's just gnarliness I was hoping to avoid, but
obviously it's not gonna work.

Fair enough.

Sure, it's a problem with multiple ranges in a maxorder block, the rest
could've been handled.

Right.


Ok, I think we're on the same page for the next version.  Thanks for the
thorough review!
