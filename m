I agree with what you guys have concluded so far.  But I do have
something I want to say about eboiv's implementation itself.

AFAICS this is using the same key as the actual data.  So why
don't you combine it with the actual data when encrypting/decrypting?

That is, add a block at the front of the actual data containing
the little-endian byte offset and then use an IV of zero.

Cheers,
