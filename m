Would it work to call unmap_mapping_range() on the char dev 
inode->i_mappings? I think you need to set the vma->fault function ptr 
for the vm_operations_struct in the original mmap(). After the mappings 
are unmapped, you can set a state variable to trigger the return of 
VM_FAULT_SIGBUS in the ->fault function when the user app accesses the 
mmap region again and triggers a page fault. The user app needs to be 
programmed to catch exceptions to deal with that.
