Putting aside people's concerns for the moment, I think this may be
formulated in a slightly more convenient way:

If
	X0, X1, ... are the data bytes
	An is 1 + Sum [i=0 .. n-1] Xi
	Bn is n + Sum [i=0 .. n-1] (n-i)Xi
		= Sum [i=1 .. n] Ai

(i.e., An, Bn are the accumulations for the first n bytes here, not the
first n blocks)

then

	A[n+v] - An = Sum[i=n .. n+v-1] Xi

	B[n+v] - Bn = v + (Sum [i=0 .. n+v-1] (n+v-i) Xi)
			- Sum [i=0 .. n-1] (n-i)Xi

		= v + (Sum [i=n .. n+v-1] (n+v-i) Xi)
			+ (Sum [i=0 .. n-1] (n+v-i) Xi)
			- Sum [i=0 .. n-1] (n-i)Xi

		= v + (Sum [i=n .. n+v-1] (n+v-i) Xi)
			+ Sum [i=0 .. n-1] ((n+v-i) - (n-i)) Xi

		= v + (Sum [i=n .. n+v-1] (n+v-i) Xi)
			+ vSum [i=0 .. n-1] Xi

		= v + v(An - 1) + Sum [i=n .. n+v-1] (n+v-i) Xi

		= vAn + Sum [i=n .. n+v-1] (n+v-i) Xi

		= vAn + vSum [i=n .. n+v-1] Xi
			+ Sum [i=n .. n+v-1] (n-i) Xi

		= vAn + vSum [i=n .. n+v-1] Xi
			+ Sum [i=n .. n+v-1] (n-i) Xi

		= vA[n+v] + Sum [i=n .. n+v-1] (n-i) Xi

Let j = i - n; then:

	B[n+v] - Bn = vA[n+v] - Sum [j=0 .. v-1] j X[j+n]

Which gives us a multiplier j that increases with the X[] index.


I think this gives a core loop along the following lines.  I don't know
whether this is correct, or whether it works -- but feel free to take
ideas from it if it helps.

Accumulators are 32 bits.  This provides for a fair number of iterations
without overflow, but large input data will still require splitting into
chunks, with modulo reduction steps in between.  There are rather a lot
of serial dependencies in the core loop, but since the operations
involved are relatively cheap, this is probably not a significant issue
in practice: the load-to-use dependency is probably the bigger concern.
Pipelined loop unrolling could address these if necessary.

The horizontal reductions (UADDV) still probably don't need to be done
until after the last chunk.


Beware: I wasn't careful with the initial values for Bn / An, so some
additional adjustments might be needed...

	ptrue   pA.s

	mov     zA.s, #0                // accumulator for An

	index   zJ.s, #0, #1            // zJ.s = [0, 1, .. V-1]

	mov     zV.s, #0

// where V is number of elements per block
//      = the number of 32-bit elements that fit in a Z-register

	add     xLimit, xX, xLen
	b       start

loop:   
	ld1b    zX.s, pP/z, [xX]
	incw    xX

	add     zA.s, pP/m, zA.s, zX.s        // zA.s += zX.s

	msb     zX.s, pP/m, zJ.s, zB.s        // zX.s := zB.s - zX.s * zJ.s

	movprfx zB, zA
	mad     zB.s, pP/m, zV.s, zX.s        // zB.s := zX.s + zA.s * V
start:  
	whilelo pP.s, xX, xLimit
	b.first loop

// Collect the partial sums together:

	uaddv   d0, pA, z0.s
	uaddv   d1, pA, z1.s

// Finally, add 1 to d0, and xLen to d1, and do modulo reduction.
