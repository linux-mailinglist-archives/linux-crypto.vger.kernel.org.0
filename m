Ok, so the BIOS is broken. Good to know. Thanks :)

But I don't know how to interpret this?

I initially contacted Asus (HQ) and they apparently had contact with AMD
about this. I was 'a bit' flabbergasted about the response though:

"We have confirmed with AMD that the Linux system supported by the customer's
CPU (AMD Ryzen 5 5500GT) is Ubuntu:20.04.x.
The corresponding Linux Kernel version is between 5.4 and 5.8, and the
customer's OS version is Linux Kernel version: 6.9.10.
The CPU is not supported."

I have no idea how Ubuntu 20.04 and kernel 5.4 got into that communication
as I clearly said I tested it with Debian and kernel 6.9 and 6.10.
Basically the same as here, except more extensive/detailed.

Thanks for the responses, much appreciated :-)
