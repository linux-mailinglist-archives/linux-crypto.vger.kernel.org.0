Ok, I will add generic IO helpers ioread128/iowrite128 for this,
keep it consistent with ioread32/iowrite32, submit patchset later.
And remove them from the driver.

The input parameter data has been endian-swap.

OK.

Yeah, the memory can be removed.

If the interface is implemented in the driver, the driver runs only on the ARM64 platform.
Therefore, there is no need to implement.
