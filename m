But that value is not the value you are using now, right? I suspect
that the line

IV[i+1] = MSB(CT[j], IV.length)

needs to be duplicated in the inner loop for j, although that would
require different versions for CS1/2/3

But it is simply the same as the penultimate block of ciphertext. So
you can simply capture it after encrypt, or before decrypt. There is
really no need to rely on the CTS transformation to pass it back to
you via the buffer that is only specified to provide an input to the
CTS transform.

So just grab it from the ciphertext of the previous round.

Thanks.
