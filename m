Here are a few more details:

The requirement from FIPS 140-3 that the crypto module (aka kernel crypto A=
PI)=20
must provide an indicator whether the algorithm(s) in use are FIPS complian=
t.

If you look at various user space libraries, they make quite an effort thes=
e=20
days to add that "service indicator" as an API. Adding such an API to the=20
crypto API is not helpful.

Thus we revert to the notion of a "global service indicator" meaning that w=
hen=20
the kernel is booted with fips=3D1, all algorithms operate in FIPS mode. Th=
is=20
means that all non-approved algos must be technically disabled.

There have been patches from me disabling RSA < 2k and others not too long=
=20
ago. In the future, I would expect additional patches disabling the use of =
GCM=20
when invoked without seqiv or disabling dh when not used with one of the up-
and-coming FFDHE / MODP groups from Nicolai's patch set. All those patches=
=20
revolve around the same issue.

Note, for some algorithms like XTS key check we already had such technical=
=20
enforcements. This was due to the fact that FIPS 140-2 required for some=20
aspects technical enforcements but for some others, "procedural" coverage (=
aka=20
documentation) was sufficient.

Ciao
Stephan
