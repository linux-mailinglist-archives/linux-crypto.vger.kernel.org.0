This info is now in the commit message of the version in my tree,
rather than sprinkled around casually in these threads. I also did a
bit more benchmarking this morning.

From <https://git.zx2c4.com/linux-dev/commit/?h=jd/crypto-5.5&id=900b79e1ff48f1f294ef3e9fb2520699c8895860>:

I'll resubmit this on Monday.
