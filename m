To make it clear: I'm personally not really enthusiastic about some of
the restrictions imposed by SP800-90 either and Jason certainly has a
point with his concerns about "subpar crypto" ([1]). However, at the
same time I'm acknowledging that for some users FIPS compliance is
simply a necessity and I don't see a strong reason why that shouldn't be
supported, if doable without negatively affecting !fips_enabled users.

I suppose that this concern about fragmentation is among the main
reasons for reservations against Stephan's LRNG patchset and that's why
I posted this RFC series here for comparison purposes. But note that, as
said ([2]), it's incomplete and the only intent was to provide at least
a rough idea on what it would take to move the current /dev/random
implementation towards SP800-90 -- I was hoping for either a hard NACK
or something along the lines of "maybe, go ahead and let's see".

Fully agreed.

The goal was not to negatively affect !fips_enabled users, but as
outlined in the cover letter ([2]), a performance impact had been
measured on ARMv7. This probably isn't something which couldn't get
sorted out, but I see no point in doing it at this stage, because
- there's still quite some stuff missing for full SP800-90 compliance
  anyway, c.f. the overview at the end of [2] and
- such optimizations would have bloated this patchset even more,
  e.g. for making fips_enabled a static_key, which should certainly go
  into a separate series.

User visible effects set aside, an obvious downside of SP800-90
compliance would be the increase in code size and the associated
maintenance burden.

That being said, I can imagine that those boot health tests could also
get enabled for !fips_enabled users in the future, if wanted: rather
than inhibiting /dev/random output on failure, a warning would get
logged instead.  Whether or not this would be seen as an improvement
is for others to judge though.

Thanks,

Nicolai
