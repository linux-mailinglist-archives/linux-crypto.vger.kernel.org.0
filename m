OK, got it. So I have to stuff all my logging into one or two very long lin=

>=20
If it fails for me locally, I can do that. If it somehow fails "in the fiel=
d",
I think most people won't be able to recompile their own Linux
kernel with debug messages let alone add their own debug messages.

Anyway, I'll just make everything dev_dbg to avoid further discussion.

Well ... I want to avoid the whole discussion about the naming of the
variable (which can be trivially changed) and what the intention may
have been,  if you allow me.

Fact is ... this variable is what receives .data / .driver_data from the=20
OF or PCI match table. So it is a means of conveying a value that is=20
specific to the table entry that was matched. No more,  no less.
In "your" device tree case you want to distinguish between=20
Armada 39x, Armada 7K/8K and Armada 9K. In "my" PCI case I
want to potentially distinguish multiple FPGA boards/images.

It wouldn't make much sense to me to do the vendor/subvendor/
device/subdevice decoding all over again in my probe routine.
So what exactly is so very wrong with the way I'm doing this?

I did a bit of side-investigation to conclude the same. So I already added =
them.

Ok  #if instead of if or #ifdef,that makes sense.
So can I just put all the PCI stuff into one big #if then?
