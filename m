Hello,

I'm still hoping that I can find some one to help enable this feature again
on 5.9-ish kernels.

I don't care about preemption being disabled for long-ish times, that is no worse than what I had
before, so even if an official in-kernel patch is not possible, I can carry an
out-of-tree patch.

Thanks,
Ben
