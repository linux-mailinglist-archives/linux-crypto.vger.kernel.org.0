My 2 cents. Preventing NTLM authentication/signing from working would be
a negative for the Linux kernel client. I don't mind if that code has
to be isolated inside cifs.ko, but it really needs to keep working,
at least until we have a pluggable client auth in cifs.ko and Samba
that allows the single-server (non AD-Domain) case to keep working
easily.
