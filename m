I apologize for my late reply - an erroneous email filter hid these
messages from me.

I'd like to take the time to thank you for all of your responses and
let me address any of the questions that were brought up on this
thread.

To reply to Sandy Harris.  The code on github is a suggested
/dev/random and /dev/urandom replacement and it has some interesting
tradeoffs from the incumbent implementation.  There are always rooms
for improvements, and I am exploring what it means to have a lockless
entropy store for Linux.

But you bring up a very important question - is AES required?  Or why
not use a hand-crafted routine to access bits.  There are two
responses to this.  The first being evident by the use of dieharder.
A naive method of shifting bits to pull out data from the entropy pool
will be detected with the 'dieharder' test suite.   The implementation
on github will write a sample file, and any assessors that pull data
from the entropy pool need to be susceptible to an avalanche. We need
a method that is quantifiable, and one that is widely accepted as
being ideal. So could a fast, but less than ideal hash function like
sha1 be used?  Absolutely,  but AES-NI is still faster on platforms
that enable it...

And this is where Stephan M=C3=BCller's post comes into play. Given the
diversity of hardware platforms, and the varying levels of dependency
on /dev/random  - there is a need on behalf of admins to tailor the
performance of this interface as it impacts *every* syscall because
each interrupt is an entropy source.  the base default should be good
enough for anyone, I agree strongly with your view on a secure by
default system.

Consider an HFT trading bot - you don't want to penalize any
interrupt.  It would be great to have a NIST-Compliant Random Number
Generator that has this interrupt-taxation as optional - but disabling
it shouldn't cause anyone to be compromised, but if you are paranoid
then additional sources can be added as further hardening.

Ultimately I'd like to make a patch file for this implementation and
run benchmarks to show the efficacy of the design.  Thank you all for
your feedback, and I'm happy to consider alternate lockless-designs.

Best regards,
Michael Brooks
