.arch_extension would be issued conditionally only for features like
CONFIG_ARM64_MTE which already have a dependency on a newer toolchain.

However, '.arch_extension memtag' is not sufficient for MTE, it needs a
prior '.arch armv8.5-a'.

We may need some push/pop_arch macros to contain the supported features.

The gas documentation says that .arch_extension may be used multiple
times to add or remove extensions. However, I couldn't find a way to
remove memtag after adding it (tried -memtag, !memtag, empty string). So
I may go with a '.arch armv8.0-a' as a base, followed by temporary
setting of '.arch armv8.5-a+memtag' (and hope we don't need combinations
of such extensions).

I can't work around this easily for MTE, there are more instructions
with register encoding. I'll see if the push/pop idea works or just
leave it to whoever does the next feature, figure out how it interacts
with MTE ;).
