Ah, ok, dropped.

Could you draw me the link between struct arm64_cpu_capabilities, as seen here,
and struct arm64_ftr_bits, which exposes the system registers to userspace/vms?

AFAICS, ARM64_HAS_RNG is private to the kernel; there is no ELF HWCAP value
exposed to userspace by this.

The adjustment of ID_AA64ISAR0.RNDR is FTR_LOWER_SAFE, which means the minimum
value of all online cpus.  (Which seems to generate a pr_warn in
check_update_ftr_reg for hot-plug secondaries that do not match.)

Unless I'm mis-reading things, there is not a setting for ARM64_CPUCAP_* that
allows exactly this.  If I use ARM64_CPUCAP_SYSTEM_FEATURE, then the feature is
not detected early enough for the boot cpu.

I can change this to ARM64_CPUCAP_STRICT_BOOT_CPU_FEATURE.  That way it is
system-wide, and also detected early enough to be used for rand_initialize().
However, it has the side effect that secondaries are not allowed to omit RNG if
the boot cpu has RNG.

Is there some setting that I've missed?  Is it ok to kick the problem down the
road until someone actually builds mis-matched hardware?

Done.

Yes, it can.
