According to RFC7919:
Peers using ffdhe8192 that want to optimize their key exchange with a
short exponent (Section 5.2) should choose a secret key of at least
400 bits.

So what is wrong with 512 bits?

Which is what I've tried to argue. For 512 bits private key and the
smallest possible FFDHE group (which has 2048 bits, with the top bit
non-zero) 2^N is always smaller than (q - 1).
As the other FFHDE groups are using even larger 'q' values, this is true
for all FFHDE groups.

And my argument here is that all zeros (and all ones) are not a value I
would expect from our RNG.

Only if (q - 2) < 2^N. And my point is that it's not.
