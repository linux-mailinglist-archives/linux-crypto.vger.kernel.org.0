Yes, these are real issues; we need to make the testing code smarter and perhaps
add some more test vectors too.  But just to clarify (since you keep using the
more general phrase "AEAD ciphers"), these issues actually only apply to RFC3686
ciphers, a.k.a. algorithms with "authenc" in their name, not to other AEADs in
the crypto API such as GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305, and AEGIS128.

There's no way to easily determine the max key size of an arbitrary AEAD
currently, since it's not stored in struct aead_alg.  That's why the current
code is scanning the test vectors.  Instead, we probably should store
information about the supported key sizes and formats directly in struct
alg_test_desc, independent of the test vectors themselves.  That would make it
possible to solve all three issues you've identified.
