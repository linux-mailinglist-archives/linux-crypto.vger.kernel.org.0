Hmm ... don't know what the rules for logging are exactly, but from my
perspective, I'm dealing with a zillion different HW configurations so=20
some feedback whether the driver detected the *correct* HW parameters -=20
or actually, whether I stuffed the correct image into my FPGA :o) - is=20
very convenient to have. And not just for my local development, but also=20
to debug deployments in the field at customer sites.

Also, looking at my log, there's other drivers that are similarly=20
(or even more) verbose.

If it's a really considered a problem, I could make it dev_dbg?

Downside of that is I will need to educate my customers into=20
building debug kernels just to get some basic support feedback ...

>=20
I'm in doubt about this one. I understand that you want to reduce the
logging in that case, but at the same time that message can convey
information as to WHY the probing fails later on ...

i.e. if it detects, say, 4 pipes on a device that, in fact, only has
2, then that may be the very reason for the FW init to fail later on.

Note that you can only get this message if the EIP(1)97 hardware has
indeed been found. You won't get it if the hardware does not exist.

Yes, I will fix that. I just lazily changed the =3D=3D into & :-)

>=20
I'm not currently passing priv to that function, so I can't access
priv->version directly. I could pass a priv pointer instead and use
the flag, but passing a bool constant seemed to be more efficient?

>=20
As far as I could tell from the existing code, "version" was
a highlevel indication of the device *type* (EIP97/EIP197B/D)
while flags was more about low-level *features*.
So in my humble opinion, version was the correct location, it
is just a confusing name. (i.e. you can have many *versions*
of an EIP197B, for instance ...)

Actually, I removed all "\n"'s from my messages as I=20
understood they are not needed? If they are really needed,
I can add them to all log strings again ... anyone else?

I have to admit I don't fully understand how these compatible
strings work. All I wanted to achieve is provide some generic
device tree entry to point to this driver, to be used for=20
devices other than Marvell. No need to convey b/d that way
(or even eip97/197, for that matter) as that can all be probed.

I would expect not, but I suppose I was fearing it wouldn't compile
with CONFIG_PCI disabled. Since I only have PCI based systems, I
can't really try this.

It's not for userspace ...
This is just information to see whether the HW is correctly
detected. Very useful for debugging and providing support.
Again, I can make it a dev_dbg, but I really DO need this.

But ... that IS the issue, isn't it? Well, apart from the actual

And same response from my side. When working with lots of different
HW, some of which only half-functional, such logging is really crucial.

>=20
Hmmm ... this is some *local* GPIO controller *inside*
the FPGA device (i.e. doesn't even leave the silicon die).
It's inside the range of the (single!) PCIE device, it's not
a seperate device and thus cannot be managed as such ...

Effectively, it's just an MMIO mapped register no different
from any other slave accessible register.
If I had given it a less explicit name, nobody would've cared.

But why would I want to do that as this is more convenient?
Basically, the "version" (wrong name, if you ask me) field was used
to identify the device type, so I just extended that to more types.
