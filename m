I don't object to moving ARC4 and/or MD4 into cifs.ko, but we do have
to be careful that we don't make the defaults "less secure" as an
unintentional side effect.

The use of ARC4 and MD4 is the NTLMSSP authentication workflow is
relatively small (narrow use case), and NTLMSSP is the default for
many servers and clients - and some of the exploits do not apply in
the case of SMB2.1 and later (which is usually required on mount in
any case).

There is little argument that kerberos ("sec=krb5") is more secure and
does not rely on these algorithms ... but there are millions of
devices (probably over 100 million) that can support SMB3.1.1 (or at
least SMB3) mounts but couldn't realistically join a domain and use
"sec=krb5" so would be forced to use "guest" mounts (or in the case of
removing RC4 use less secure version of NTLMSSP).

In the longer term where I would like this to go is:
- make it easier to "require Kerberos" (in module load parameters for cifs.ko)
- make sure cifs.ko builds even if these algorithms are removed from
the kernel, and that mount by default isn't broken if the user chooses
to build without support for NTLMSSP, the default auth mechanism (ie
NTLMSSP being disabled because required crypto algorithms aren't
available)
- add support in Linux for a "peer to peer" auth mechanism (even if it
requires an upcall), perhaps one that is certificate based and one
that is not (and thus much easier to use) that we can plumb into
SPNEGO (RFC2478).    By comparison, it sounds like it is much easier
in Windows to add in additional authentication mechanisms (beyond
Kerberos, PKU2U and NTLMSSP) - see
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/jj852232(v=ws.11)
so perhaps we just need to do something similar for the kernel client
and samba and ksmbd where they call out to a library which is
configured to provide the SPNEGO blobs for the new stronger
peer-to-peer authentication mechanism the distro chooses to enable
(for cases where using Kerberos for authentication is not practical)
