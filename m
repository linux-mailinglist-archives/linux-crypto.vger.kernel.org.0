For the single block cipher parameter, another option is to derive
it from the xctr_name.  That is, once you have the skcipher for
xctr_name, you extract its cra_name, assuming that it must be of
the form xctr(%s) then you just strip away the xctr() and get the
single block cipher name that way.

The purpose of having the parameter explicitly is so that the
instantiatied algorithm is automatically torn down when the
underlying algorithm is replaced with a better version.

This is in general unnecessary if you're simply using the
single block cipher to generate setup material.

Cheers,
