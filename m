The kernel already had ahash-based multibuffer hashing years ago.  It failed
spectacularly, as it was extremely complex, buggy, slow, and potentially
insecure as it mixed requests from different contexts.  Sure, it could have been
improved slightly by adding flush support, but most issues would have remained.

Synchronous hashing really is the right model here.  One of the main performance
issues we are having with dm-verity and fs-verity is the scheduling hops
associated with the workqueues on which the dm-verity and fs-verity work runs.
If there was another scheduling hop from the worker task to another task to do
the actual hashing, that would be even worse and would defeat the point of doing
multibuffer hashing.  And with the ahash based API this would be difficult to
avoid, as when an individual request gets submitted and put on a queue somewhere
it would lose the information about the original submitter, so when it finally
gets hashed it might be by another task (which the original task would then have
to wait for).  I guess the submitter could provide some sort of tag that makes
the request be put on a dedicated queue that would eventually get processed only
by the same task (which might also be needed for security reasons anyway, due to
all the CPU side channels), but that would add lots of complexity to add tag
support to the API and support an arbitrary number of queues.

And then there's the issue of request lengths.  With one at a time submission
via 'ahash_request', each request would have its own length.  Having to support
multibuffer hashing of different length requests would add a massive amount of
complexity and edge cases that are difficult to get correct, as was shown by the
old ahash based code.  This suggests that either the API needs to enforce that
all the lengths are the same, or it needs to provide a clean API (my patch)
where the caller just provides a single length that applies to all messages.

So the synchronous API really seems like the right approach, whereas shoehorning
it into the asynchronous hash API would result in something much more complex
and not actually useful for the intended use cases.

If you're concerned about the hardcoding to 2x specifically, how about the
following API instead:

    int crypto_shash_finup_mb(struct shash_desc *desc,
                              const u8 *datas[], unsigned int len,
                              u8 *outs[], int num_msgs)

This would allow extension to higher interleaving factors.

I do suspect that anything higher than 2x isn't going to be very practical for
in-kernel use cases, where code size, latency, and per-request memory usage tend
to be very important.  Regardless, this would make the API able to support
higher interleaving factors.
