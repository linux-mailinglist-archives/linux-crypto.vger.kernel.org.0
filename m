The impact of other workloads is much less likely for a short test,
and if it does happen you are likely to see a value that is abnormally large.

I'm not sure what the 'warm-up' was for.
The first test will be slow(er) due to I-cache misses.
(That will be more noticeable for big software loops - like blake2.)
Change to test parameters can affect branch prediction but that also only
usually affects the first test with each set of parameters.
(Unlikely to affect AES, but I could see that effect when testing
mul_u64_u64_div_u64().)
The only other reason for a 'warm-up' is to get the cpu frequency fast
and fixed - and there ought to be a better way of doing that.

My userspace test code runs each test 10 times and prints all 10 values.
I then look at them to see how consistent they are.

I'd actually go for disabling interrupts.
What you are seeing is the effect of interrupts not happening
(which is likely for a short test, but not for a long one).

The main reason for doing that is reducing the time the tests take on a
system that is massively slower (and doing software AES).
Maybe someone want to run the test cases on an m68k :-)
