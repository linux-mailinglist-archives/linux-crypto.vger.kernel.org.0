But the scomp API appears to be "internal only":

include/crypto/internal/scompress.h:static inline int crypto_scomp_decompress(struct crypto_scomp *tfm,

What's the correct API calling sequence to do a simple decompress?

Dmitry has, I think, a bit of this already in [1] that could maybe be
generalized if it'd needed?

pstore still needs the "worst case" API to do a preallocation, though.

Anyway, if I could have an example of how to use scomp in pstore, I
could better see where to wire up the proposed zbufsize API...

Thanks!
