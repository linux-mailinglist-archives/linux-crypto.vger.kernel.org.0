Can you elaborate on how this change would actually solve a problem for you?  Do
you actually have a program that is using /dev/random with O_NONBLOCK, and that
handles the EAGAIN error correctly?  Just because you're seeing a program wait
for the RNG to be initialized doesn't necessarily mean that this change would
make a difference, as the program could just be reading from /dev/random without
O_NONBLOCK or calling getrandom() without GRND_NONBLOCK.  The behavior of those
(more common) cases would be unchanged by Jason's proposed change.
