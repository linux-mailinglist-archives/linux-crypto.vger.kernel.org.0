arc4random's contract is supposed to be that it always succeeds and
always produces cryptographic output. It cannot use GRND_INSECURE or
other insecure fallback methods to avoid blocking. It has to block.
This function (inherently, in its contract) is not usable for early
boot stuff where one is pretending to want actual cryptographic
entropy but is just as happy getting some "high quality" non-CS stuff,
and thereby would be just as happy with rand() or likely even with
"42". Programs that will run in that context on Linux need to be
explicitly aware of the messy "early boot" situation and figure out
how they're going to handle it securely or if they even wanted CS
randomness to begin with. Fortunately virtually nothing has to do
that. On most (non-embedded) systems, init can just bring up a rw
filesystem with saved entropy on it early and load that, then provide
a fully-working environment to programs it invokes.

AT_RANDOM is unusable as a fallback here because it's equivalent to
GRND_INSECURE. It's silently broken at early boot time. In musl we're
likely going to end up using the legacy SYS_sysctl on pre-getrandom
kernels even though it spammed syslog just because it seems to be the
only way to get blocking secure entropy on those kernels.
