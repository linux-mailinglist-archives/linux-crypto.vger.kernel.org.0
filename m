according to the naming conventions there in figures 447 and following:

- x and y: DH private key (kernel calls it secret set with dh_set_secret or
encoded into param.key)

- g^x mod p  / g^y mod p: DH public keys from either end that is communicated
over the wire (corresponding to the the DH private keys of x and y) - to set
it, you initialize a dh request and set the public key to it with
kpp_request_set_input. After performing the crypto_kpp_compute_shared_secret
you receive the shared secret

- g^xy mod p: DH shared secret - this is the one that is to be used for the
subsequent hashing /HMAC operations as this is the one that is identical on
both, the host and the controller.
