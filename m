I don't see what a zero-sized input has to do with this though.
When the walk->nbytes is zero, that means that you must never
call the done function, because the walk state could be in error
in which case everything would have been freed already and calling
the done function may potentially cause a double-free.

I don't understand why in the case of AEAD you cannot structure
your code such that the done function is not called when nbytes
is zero.

Cheers,
