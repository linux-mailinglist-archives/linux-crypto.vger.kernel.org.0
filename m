True

To be clear, making the cipher API internal only is something that I
am proposing but hasn't been widely discussed yet. So if you make a
good argument why it is a terrible idea, I'm sure it will be taken
into account.

The main issue is that the cipher API is suboptimal if you process
many blocks in sequence, since SIMD implementations will not be able
to amortize the cost of kernel_fpu_begin()/end(). This is something
that we might be able to fix in other ways (and a SIMD get/put
interface has already been proposed which looks suitable for this as
well) but that would still involve an API change for something that
isn't the correct abstraction in the first place in many cases. (There
are multiple implementations of ccm(aes) using cipher_encrypt_one() in
a loop, for instance, and these are not able to benefit from, e.g,
the accelerated implementation that I created for arm64, since it open
codes the CCM operations)

Why on earth would you implement eboiv for compatibility purposes, and
then allow it to be used in random other combinations? Pushing back on
the use of arbitrary cipher cocktails is one of the reasons I'd prefer
the cipher API to become crypto internal, since it is typically much
better to stick with recommended combinations that are known to be
secure/

That is a very good point, and something that I have been meaning to
bring up myself: ever since we switched from [a]blkciphers so
skciphers, we lost the ability to operate synchronously on virtual
addresses, like we still have with shashes (as opposed to ahashes)
today. AEADs suffer from the same limitation.

The thing is, while switching to the cipher API does work around that,
it is not a proper fix, and going forward, we should really address
the above limitation in a sane way.

That is absolutely true.

In summary, I think implementing eboiv for arbitrary ciphers would be
a mistake, since it is a mode that is intended for compatibility.
However, if you do, I think going with the cipher API for now is fine,
since you are using it in a sane way (i.e., to encrypt a single block
of plaintext with an a priori unknown cipher). If it ever becomes an
internal-only crypto API, we'll propose something else by that time.
