iommu_snp_enable() already has the disable_snp label where it does that. If
you wanna clear the flag in snp_rmptable_init() you'll simply have to sprinkle
flag clearing across more places. I dunno if that is really better frankly...

Right, especially if that function would run now at arbitrary points in time
- as this is the main reason we're doing this whole dance.

BUT!

If you grab the hotplug lock and you realize that you don't have all CPUs
online and since we zapped the hotplug notifier and since SNP enable would
fail anyway, we should simply check if all CPUs are online and return error
if not instead of running the IPIs.

But we've delayed this init to the latest possible moment.

So much so that when this "prolonged blocking" happens, that is very much
absolutely indispensable.

And besides, we're not really running SNP guests here so to me that feedback
doesn't really make much sense...

Let's slow down here.

So the LLM is talking about a use case where you have unencrypted VMs running
and then userspace can go and poke /dev/sev, zero out that MSR_VM_HSAVE_PA in
the process but that's the MSR which contains the physical address where host
state is saved on a VMRUN and if that MSR is cleared because SNP init needs
it, the machine would explode.

Ok, so far so good, I don't see anything wrong with the use case - nothing's
stopping the admin from modprobing ccp and then launching SNP guests.

Now, you're talking about some psp_dead - yet another silly boolean folks love
to introduce in the SEV code - and then something about that init_ex_path
hack. I don't know what that means, frankly.

What my simple intuition says is, *if* snp_prepare() runs,  then no guests
should do VMRUN anymore until they're ready to do that again.

Which begs the question: if snp_prepare() clears MSR_VM_HSAVE_PA, how can you
even run normal VMs after that?

Hmmm.

This code is a total mess.

struct sev_data_snp_init_ex data;
...

... the else branch executes so you do

	arg = NULL;

...

and now *after* it, you're testing data:

        dev_dbg(sev->dev, "SEV-SNP firmware initialized, SEV-TIO is %s\n",
                data.tio_en ? "enabled" : "disabled");

Which *is* uninitialized stack data.

So the AI is right AFAICT.

If I were the AI, I'd say, what a total mess this code is. This
__sev_snp_init_locked() thing needs serious cleanup because it is too
convoluted to exist. And silly bugs like that creep in, as a result.

If I were maintaining this, I'd enforce a mandatory driver cleanup before any
new features come in. For example, __sev_snp_init_locked() needs proper
splitting and streamlining instead of doing gazillion things and with
a conditional in it which has consequences about the code after it. :-\

That's a good catch.

Yes, this is a short-term fix for stable.

But that "handling" in there is just nuts. You have this:

	snp_range_list = kzalloc(PAGE_SIZE, GFP_KERNEL);

	...

        rc = walk_iomem_res_desc(IORES_DESC_NONE, IORESOURCE_MEM, 0, ~0,
				  snp_range_list, snp_filter_reserved_mem_regions);

That function calls

		snp_filter_reserved_mem_regions(resource *, snp_range_list);

and that resource walking BIOS-like yuck code is iterating over the resources
and calling ->func each time.

So we pass in a *page* but then that range list *array* we turn it into, is
not a multiple of the element size of 24 AFAICT.

So that last element can trail and overflow heap. Lovely.

So this thing needs complete change: *actually* pass in an array instead of
a page so that you're not trailing, check the current element index against
the array size instead of doing obscure struct size calculations which are
visible only to very motivated reviewers like an AI and then just get rid of
the overflow possibility in the first place.

So, your set is kinda ready to go and I'll take it but if I were you, right
after this, I'll sit down and fix all that crap in sev-dev.c. Do a nice
patchset, simple backportable fixes first and proper refactoring and cleanup
ontop.

Just piling up more stuff ontop is not maintanable in the long run.

But hey, I'm not maintaining this thing so I'm off the chain here for
a change!

:-P :-P
