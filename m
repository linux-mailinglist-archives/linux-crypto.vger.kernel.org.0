I see.  Is there any way of you finding out that the key has been
invalidated apart from trying out the crypto and having it fail?

Ideally you'd have a global counter that gets incremented everytime
an invalidation occurs.  You can then regenerate your key if its
generation counter differs from the current global counter.

Also when the crypto fails due to an invalid key you're currently
calling skcipher_walk_done with zero.  This is wrong as the done
function must be called with a positive value or an error.  In
some cases this can cause a crash in scatterwalk.

IOW you should just repeat the crypto operation after regenerating
the key rather than looping around again.

Cheers,
