CRYPTO_ALG_OPTIONAL_KEY isn't meant for this use case, but rather for algorithms
that have both keyed and unkeyed versions such as BLAKE2b and BLAKE2s, and also
for algorithms where the "key" isn't actually a key but rather is an initial
value that has a default value, such as CRC-32 and xxHash.

It appears that that the case you're asking about is handled by using a
different algorithm name, e.g. see the "paes" algorithms in
drivers/crypto/ccree/cc_cipher.c.
