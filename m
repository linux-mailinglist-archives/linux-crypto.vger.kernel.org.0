OK so when I actually sat down to work on this. I realized this is
bigger than I thought. If we want to have error == -1 for all return
from psp-sev.h functions where the PSP isn't called yet there are a
lot of changes. For example if CONFIG_CRYPTO_DEV_SP_PSP is not defined
all these stubs need to be to set `*errror == -`, basically all these
functions need to be updated.

So to keep this series more targeted. I think I'll drop the error
here. And just have this patch print the rc value. If what I said
above seems reasonable I'll do those error refactors. Are people
envisioning something else for the error fixups?
