Sorry for the inconvenience caused by the inability to test provided
patches, as QEMU currently does not support emulation of the XSHA1 and
XSHA256 instructions.

Besides, since the previous patch adding XSHA384 and XSHA512 instruction
support was not accepted, I would like to ask whether adding emulation
support for XSHA384 and XSHA512 instructions in QEMU would help the
crypto community evaluate and accept the corresponding kernel patches.

Thanks for your suggestions. I will only add XSHA256 instruction support
for the SHA-256 algorithm in the next version of the patch.
