No. By using the pkey for a crypto operation the hardware
checks the verification pattern and if there is a mismatch
it simple rejects the operation. Theoretically such an operation
can only partly complete and then a pkey could get invalid.
I have no way to check if the pkey is still valid before the
cpacf instruction call.

That's right. I'll try to rework the functions this way to
avoid calling skciper_walk_done with 0.
