As I am responsible for developing such CAVS/ACVP harness as well, I played 
with the idea of going through AF_ALG. I discarded it because I do not see the 
benefit why we should add an interface solely for the purpose of testing. 
Further, it is a potentially dangerous one because the created instance of the 
DRBG is "seeded" from data provided by the caller.

Thus, I do not see the benefit from adding that extension, widening a user 
space interface solely for the purpose of CAVS testing. I would not see any 
other benefit we have with this extension. In particular, this interface would 
then be always there. What I could live with is an interface that can be 
enabled at compile time for those who want it.

Besides, when you want to do CAVS testing, the following ciphers are still not 
testable and thus this patch would only be a partial solution to get the 
testing covered:

- AES KW (you cannot get the final IV out of the kernel - I played with the 
idea to return the IV through AF_ALG, but discarded it because of the concern 
above)

- OFB/CFB MCT testing (you need the IV from the last round - same issue as for 
AES KW)

- RSA

- DH

- ECDH

With these issues, I would assume you are better off creating your own kernel 
module just like I did that externalizes the crypto API to user space but is 
only available on your test kernel and will not affect all other users.

Ciao
Stephan
