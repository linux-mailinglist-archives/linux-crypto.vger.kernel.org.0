These fields are indeed optional.

This however must be implemented *if* the underlying algorithm
(IOW refer to the generic implementation) supports them.  The
set of supported values must not be smaller than that of the
generic algorithm.

In practice this shouldn't be a big deal as it's just a matter
of truncating the ICV.

Note that you don't actually need to supply a setauthsize function
if all values (less than maxauthsize are supported).

Cheers,
