I think the lack of extensibility is the biggest problem with this
API.  Now I confess I too have used the magic number 2 in the
lskcipher patch-set, but there I think at least it was more
justifiable based on the set of algorithms we currently support.

Here I think the evidence for limiting this to 2 is weak.  And the
amount of work to extend this beyond 2 would mean ripping this API
out again.

So let's get this right from the start.  Rather than shoehorning
this into shash, how about we add this to ahash instead where an
async return is a natural part of the API?

In fact, if we do it there we don't need to make any major changes
to the API.  You could simply add an optional flag that to the
request flags to indicate that more requests will be forthcoming
immediately.

The algorithm could then either delay the current request if it
is supported, or process it immediately as is the case now.

Cheers,
