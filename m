Indeed.  Stephan, could you please explain exactly what additional
seeding sources are needed over the current jitter+/dev/random sources
(and why).  Or even better, add those seeding sources that we must have
in your patch series so that they can be evaluated together.

As it stands this patch series seems to be adding a lot of code without
any uses.

Thanks,
