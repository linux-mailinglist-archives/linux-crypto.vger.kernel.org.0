Well, initially I was looking for a "KEY_NEED_USE" permission that
would allow using the key for encryption/decryption, but not to
actually read it. But then I was told by some people that the
KEY_NEED_SEARCH permission already serves exactly this purpose (i.e.
that when you can find the key, it means you can use it). I would
imagine that any practical use case for trusted keys would involve
encrypting/decrypting some data with the key (maybe not flowing
directly from/to userspace, but what use is a key with which you can
encrypt only some "internal" data...?), so I'm not sure where we want
to draw the boundary of what is safe to do with (userspace-unreadable
but findable) keyring keys... Maybe the keyring API needs some way to
control the intended usage of each key (something a bit like the "key
usage" in X.509 certificates [1]) - so you can e.g. mark some key to
be used for XYZ, but not for AF_ALG or dm-crypt...

Either way, I agree that this functionality opens up a potential
security hole (in that it makes it much more likely that a
vulnerability in the crypto drivers or crypto algorithms themselves
can reveal the value of a key that is not supposed to be readable by
userspace). However, I'm not sure how to mitigate this without some
new "KEY_NEED_PROCESS_ARBITRARY_DATA" permission or something... For
now I can at least add a Kconfig option to enable/disable keyring
support in AF_ALG so that people/distros who want both keyring and
AF_ALG enabled, but do not want to expose keyring keys via AF_ALG, can
just disable it.

BTW, I'm still undecided if I should convert this patch to use key IDs
rather than descriptions, but I tend to prefer to stay with the
current approach (mainly because it would be a lot of effort to
rewrite everything :)
