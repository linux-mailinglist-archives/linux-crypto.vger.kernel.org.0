Hi Jason and Eric.

To clarify, the code in question is not written by me and I did not see 
the code myself, the code is from another team. We discovered this 
change during the test when we try to run our userspace program on a 
newer version kernel, and it blocks for a long time during the boot 
process. It seems that the author use the -EAGAIN error code as an 
indication that /dev/random is not ready and they implemented a "best 
effort" mechanism in terms of getting random data.

Honestly speaking I don't know what they are using those random data 
for, and I am trying to get some background knowledge for this flag and 
the change, maybe figure out whether that team is using the flag as 
intended, and bring this up with them.
