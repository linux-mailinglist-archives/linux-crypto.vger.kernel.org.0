Well, now you're getting into the philosophical issue of imposing
requirements on the client which seemed to be the main point of
contention in earlier versions. If you start requiring the client to
put the DMA operations in a certain order (and it's not based on any
HW requirement but rather on how the DMA driver is implemented) then
how is it better than having the client just drive the locking
altogether like pre v11? We won't get away without at least some
requirements - like the client doing register I/O over DMA or
providing the scratchpad address - but I think just wrapping the
existing queue with additional descriptors in a way transparent to
consumers is better in this case. And as I said: the HPG doesn't
explicitly say that it unlocks the pipe *after* the descriptor with
the unlock bit is processed. Doesn't even hint at what real the
ordering is.

You'd think so but the HPG actually does use the word "dummy" to
describe the write operation with lock/unlock bits set. Though it does
not recommend any particular register to do it.

Yeah, I do the same for QCE, write to the version register.
