I don't entirely buy the second paragraph.  It could be the case that the input
is less than or equal to one SHA-256 block (64 bytes), in which case leaking
'a' through 'h' would reveal the final SHA-256 hash if the input length is
known.  And note that callers might consider either the input, the resulting
hash, or both to be sensitive information -- it depends.

Your change itself is fine, though.  As you mentioned, these assignments get
optimized out, so they weren't accomplishing anything.

The fact is, there just isn't any way to guarantee in C code that all sensitive
variables get cleared.

So we shouldn't (and generally don't) bother trying to clear individual u32's,
ints, etc. like this, but rather only structs and arrays, as clearing those is
more likely to work as intended.
