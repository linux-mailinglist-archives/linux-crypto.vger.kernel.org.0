To be honest, I don't think we don't need complexity like this - if
boot time is critical on such a slow system, you probable won't have
XOR built in, assuming it even makes sense to do software XOR on such
a system.

It is indeed preferable to have a numerator that fits in a U32, and so
1000 would be equally suitable in that regard, but I think I will
stick with 800 if you don't mind.
