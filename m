Yes, that's what I plan to do in GNU projects like Coreutils and Emacs.

Although I don't recommend arc4random, I suppose it was added for 
source-code compatibility with the BSDs (I wasn't involved in the decision).

It hasn't fully sailed since we haven't done a release.

That's a bit harsh. Coreutils still has its own random number generator 
because it needed to be portable to a bunch of platforms and there was 
no standard. Eventually we'll rip it out but there's no rush. Having 
written much of that code I can reliably assert that it was not fun.
