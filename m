And I assume it's in the standard install of the RpiOS or similarly
widespread?

Yup, but I'd say it bad enough to qualify as regression. If it would be
something like 10 seconds it might be something different, but 3 minutes
will look like a hang to many people, and I'm pretty sure that's
something Linus doesn't want to see. But let's not involve him for now
and first try to solve this differently.

Stefan, did you try to see how long it would take when the sleep time is
reduced? I guess that might be our best chance to solve this, as
reverting the culprit afaics would lead to regressions for others.

/me wonders if the sleep time could even be reduced futher that 100

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)
