If your device does "crypto", then it should tie into the existing
kernel crypto apis so that your, and everyone elses, userspace code also
uses the correct, existing, userspace crypto apis.

We do not want to create a one-off-vendor-specific api for only one
piece of hardware out there.  That way lies madness and is not how we do
things in the kernel whenever possible.
