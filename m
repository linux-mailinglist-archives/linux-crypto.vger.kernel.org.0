It certianly seems unfortunate, as it goes against the premise of having
HINT space instructions. Most software will want to enable HINT space
instructions from ARMv8.x but nothing else to ensure binary
compatibility with existing hardware.

I see the same is true for pointer authentication judging by:

https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/as/AArch64-Extensions.html#AArch64-Extensions

... so worth raising with toolchain folk as a general principle even if
we have to bodge around it for now.

Thanks,
Mark.
