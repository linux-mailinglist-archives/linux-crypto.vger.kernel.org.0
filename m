Hey Eric,

Thanks for the review. I just finished porting the x86_64 code, which
I'll submit alongside v2 tomorrow, pending a night of sleep and some
rereading: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/zx2c4/linux.git/=
commit/?h=3Djd/crypto-5.5&id=3D7380dd3ac2b8ea4a2b1b111139426c7d25374bba

It matches the style of the 64x64 one, so that it's easy to compare
them. And, as mentioned in the commit message, it precomputes
s1,s2,s3,s4, speeding up updates.

Oh, right, duh. Okay, I'll submit v2 once I get those tests passing. Thanks=

Ack.

Sure, I'll add comments.

Thanks. Good catch.

I'll make it explicit. The way things work right now, the desc_ctx is
an array of a .config-number of keys. In some future cleanup, I think
that should basically be opaque instead, but I'll leave this out of
this now, and instead fix up the signatures to make clear what's going
on, and audit all callers.
