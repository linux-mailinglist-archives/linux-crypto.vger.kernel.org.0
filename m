Sometimes. You may sort by "Repro" column here to get the ratio:

It's finding lots of race conditions provoked bugs (I would say it's
the most common cause of kernel bugs).

Well, you are missing that wireguard is not the only subsystem
syzkaller tests (in fact, it does not test it at all) and there are
3000 other subsystems :)
If we enable verbose debug logging for all of them, we will get storm
of output and the wireguard logging you are interested in may simply
be evicted from the 1MB buffer. Also, the expected case is that a
program does not crash, in that case we waste performance for
unnecessary logging (and not finding bugs because of that).

In some cases there are reproducers, in some cases a bug is trivial to
debug based on the crash report (no tracing needed).

But additional debug checks are useful in any testing.
