I do not really have a way to validate that statement, I just figured
that the operator being wrong meant that something could go wrong that
was not intended.

Looking at this more, I think the only reason that the code works as is
is because PD_CTL_HOST_READY is 1 AND CRYPTO_ALG_TYPE_AHASH is not used.

(alg_type == CRYPTO_ALG_TYPE_AEAD) ? PD_CTL_HASH_FINAL : 0 is evaluated
first, which results in either PD_CTL_HASH_FINAL or 0.

Then (alg_type == CRYPTO_ALG_TYPE_AHASH) is evaluated, which is
evaluated to either 0 or 1.

Then we mask everything together:

PD_CTL_HOST_READY | (0 || 1) | (PD_CTL_HOST_READY || 0)

If PD_CTL_HOST_READY was anything other than BIT(0), we would have an
extra 0x1 in the mask. That realistically might not matter, I did not
have a full look over the code to see what this might mean. If
CRYPTO_ALG_TYPE_AHASH was used, it could be used over
CRYPTO_ALG_TYPE_AEAD and PD_CTL_HASH_FINAL would never get added to the
mask, which certainly sounds like a bug.

It does not with that diff. I guess it is entirely up to you which one
we go with.

Thank you for all the analysis and taking a look over the patch, I
appreciate it!
