The only place I've heard of a viable "soft requirement" for real
entropy is for salting the hash function used in hash table maps to
harden them against DoS via intentional collisions. This is a small
but arguably legitimate usage domain. Most use of random() is not
this, and should not be this -- the value of deterministic execution
for ability to reproduce crashes, debug, etc. is real, and the value
of actual entropy vs a deterministic-seeded prng is imaginary.

The purpose of arc4random has always been *cryptographically secure*
entropy, not "gratuitously replace random() and break reproducible
behavior because the programmer does not understand the difference".
Nobody should be advocating for using these functions for anything
except secure secrets.
