I would prefer that. But if it is fine to disallow chaining altogether
for XTS, why can't we do the same for cbc-cts? In both cases, user
space cannot be relying on it today, since the output is incorrect,
even for inputs that are a round multiple of the block size but are
broken up and chained.

No disagreement on the horrid. But polluting the API for an issue that
only affects AF_ALG, which can't possibly be working as expected right
now is not a great thing either.

Given the fact that algos that require chaining are broken today and
nobody noticed until Stephan started relying on the skcipher request
object's IV field magically retaining its value on subsequent reuse, I
would prefer it if we could simply mark all of them as non-chainable
and be done with it. (Note that Stephan's case was invalid to begin
with)
