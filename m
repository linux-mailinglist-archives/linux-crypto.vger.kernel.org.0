kbuild test robot complained that calling crypto_grab_spawn() from here is not
allowed when "crypto" is built-in but "crypto_algapi" is a module.  (cipher.c is
part of "crypto"; this is different from the new-style algorithm types which
have their own modules.)  So I'll be sending out a new version which makes
crypto_grab_cipher() an inline function.
