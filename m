It has been a while since I looked at this code so I forgot that
deferred_grow_zone is essentially blocked out once we start the
per-node init.

So we cannot stop in the middle of a max order block. That shouldn't
be possible as part of the issue is that the buddy allocator will
attempt to access the buddy for the page which could cause issues if
it tries to merge the page with one that is not initialized. So if
your code supports that then it is definitely broken. That was one of
the reasons for all of the variable weirdness in
deferred_init_maxorder. I was going through and making certain that
while we were initializing the range we were freeing the pages in
MAX_ORDER aligned blocks and skipping over whatever reserved blocks
were there. Basically it was handling the case where a single
MAX_ORDER block could span multiple ranges.

On x86 this was all pretty straightforward and I don't believe we
needed the code, but I seem to recall there were some other
architectures that had more complex memory layouts at the time and
that was one of the reasons why I had to be careful to wait until I
had processed the full MAX_ORDER block before I could start freeing
the pages, otherwise it would start triggering memory corruptions.
