IMO that's the way to go: even if these are required to be supported by 
Zicclsm, we still need to deal with the performance implications.

I guess it's kind of a grey area, but I'd agrue that it is: we merged 
support for V when the only implementation (ie, QEMU) supported 
misaligned accesses, so we're stuck with that being the defacto 
behavior.  As part of adding support for the K230 we'll need to then add 
the kernel-mode vector misaligned access handlers, but that doesn't seem 
so hard.

So I'd say we should update the hwprobe docs to say that key only 
reflects scalar accesses (or maybe even just integer accesses?  that's 
all we're testing for) -- essentially just make the documentation match 
the implementation, as that'll keep ABI compatibility.  Then we can add 
a new key for vector misaligned access performance.
