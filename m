Well, as Milan points out, dm-crypt may use the upper bits as well,
but the point I was making was about the userland interface. If you
care about spec compliance for the sake of it, I don't understand why
you dismiss a broken userland->kernel interface that silently fails
and corrupts your data as something we should just live with, and just
assume nobody will ever be silly enough to use it the way the spec
describes it, and use all the available IV bits.

True. But now that the cat is out of the bag, we have an obligation to
our users to ensure that a known problem does not corrupt their data.

Then we'd still have two implementations that behave differently, and
this is not how abstractions work. If a driver implements xts(aes),
then it should produce the same output (and return value) for every
input.

How would you find out if the default fails? Either it corrupts your
data, or it fails with an error that is specific to CAAM, and so we
would have to update the dm-crypt code to deal with en/decryption
failures that can only occur in this particular case. This is
*exactly* the thing I argued against before, when we discussed zero
length inputs: the reason we want the workaround in the driver is
because it is contained, and its peculiarities don't leak into other
layers.

Well, the reality is that we OS guys get to clean up after the h/w
guys all the time. I agree that explicit failure is better than silent
corruption, but that still means there are corner cases where things
just don't work. So the only acceptable way to me is to fix this with
a s/w workaround, and as I already pointed out, this could simply be
the xts template wrapped around the accelerated ECB implementation
exposed by the driver.
