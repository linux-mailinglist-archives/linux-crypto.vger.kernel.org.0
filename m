Do you object to the interface, or the implementation?

The implementation can be improved easily enough at a later date.

getrandom may be fast for bulk generation.  It's not that great for
generating a few bits here and there.  For example, shuffling a
1,000-element array takes 18 microseconds with arc4random_uniform in
glibc, and 255 microseconds with the na=C3=AFve getrandom-based
implementation (with slightly biased results; measured on an Intel
i9-10900T, Fedora's kernel-5.18.11-100.fc35.x86_64).

What is the kernel interface you are talking about?  From an interface
standpoint, arc4random_buf and getrandom are very similar, with the main
difference is that arc4random_buf cannot report failure (except by
terminating the process).

Historically, kernel developers were not interested in solving some of
the hard problems (especially early seeding) that prevent the use of
getrandom during early userspace stages.

Some applications still need to run in configurations where getrandom is
not available (either because the kernel is too old, or because it has
been disabled via seccomp).

The performance numbers suggest that we benefit from buffering in user
space.  It might not be necessary to implement expansion in userspace.
getrandom (or /dev/urandom) with a moderately-sized buffer could be
sufficient.

But that's an implementation detail, and something we can revisit later.
If we vDSO acceleration for getrandom (maybe using the userspace
thread-specific data donation we discussed for rseq), we might
eventually do way with the buffering in glibc.  Again this is an
implementation detail we can change easily enough.

Thanks,
Florian
