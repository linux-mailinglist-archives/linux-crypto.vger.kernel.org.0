Thread [1] is a patch that removes the kernel's last
architecture-optimized implementation of MD5, which is a broken and
deprecated algorithm anyway.  So it's not just AF_ALG that's motivating
that particular patch, but also a desire to focus effort on modern
algorithms and keep the different Linux architectures consistent.  So I
think the scope of that thread is more narrow than what you're claiming.

Also, it's already been established that for now AF_ALG will have to
keep the software code used by a small set of userspace programs such as
iwd.  So no, it cannot be completely removed yet (except on systems that
don't use any of these programs, where it can be already).  However,
that doesn't mean that we shouldn't be nudging people towards better
solutions, with an eye towards future attack surface reductions.

It's long been clear that by far the best way to accelerate symmetric
crypto is to just put it in the CPU, or in-line in the storage or
network controller.  Indeed, that's what almost everyone does now.

So I would expect the demand for this kind of interface to symmetric
crypto to continue to decline, as it already has been for a long time.
And as you pointed out, AF_ALG doesn't work well for it anyway, which
makes AF_ALG increasingly kind of besides the point.

There are still some in-kernel users of the asynchronous crypto APIs,
for example IPsec and dm-crypt.  So I think your prediction of the
demise of these APIs is a bit premature as well.  But yes, at least for
the symmetric crypto, kernel subsystems have been been repeatedly seeing
that the async support just isn't worth it.  We'll see more kernel
subsystems switching to sync-only.  But in practice this is a gradual
transition.

Anyway, I don't think I'm proposing conflicting things.  We can and
should document a general deprecation of AF_ALG, while also helping
update userspace programs to no longer use it, while also applying
various hardening measures to reduce AF_ALG's attack surface as best we
can in the meantime.  There are multiple independent hardening measures
that could be applied, and they will be up for discussion on the
individual patches that implement them.
