Hi,

thanks for the review.

Yes, exactly like that. One checksum for the whole filesystem,
specificed by a number in the superblock item.

I'd put it that performance is important and blake2 has been selected as
the fastest from the modern hashes (ie. sha3 was rejected for that
reason). We're going to add cryptographically strong hashes (blake2,
sha256) and a fast one (xxhash). So the users should choose what's the
best for their usecase given the trade-offs.

If the question is inspired by the current discussions around wireguard
and library versions, we're fine with using the current API as it's
reasonable for the hash algorithms.

Improvements regarding reduction of the overhead would be welcome but
is not important at the moment.

I'll send v2 with the review comments addressed. Thanks.

d.
