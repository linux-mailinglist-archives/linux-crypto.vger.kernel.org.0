The hw_random framework only makes these hardware RNG accessible for in-ker=
nel=20
as well as user space use.

The quality field is used by add_hwgenerator_randomness to increase the Lin=
ux=20
RNG entropy estimator accordingly. This is the issue.

And giving an entropy rate based on post-processed data is meaningless.

The concern is, for example, that you use a DRBG that you seeded with, say,=
 a=20
zero buffer. You get perfect random data from it that no statistical test c=
an=20
disprove. Yet we know this data stream has zero entropy. Thus, we need to g=
et=20
to the source and assess its entropy.

So you are saying that the output for the exynos-trng is straight from a ri=
ng=20
oscillator without any post-processing of any kind?

If this is the case, I would like to suggest you add that statement to the =
git=20
commit message with that reference. If so, then I would withdraw my objecti=
on.
