I'm afraid that's not an accurate summary of what uses the vector registers in
kernel mode.  The main use case is crypto, and most of the crypto code uses a
lot of vector registers.  Some of the older crypto code uses at most 8 vector
registers (xmm0-xmm7) for 32-bit compatibility, but newer code uses 16 or even
up to 32 YMM or ZMM registers.  The new AES-GCM code for example uses all 32
vector registers, and the new AES-XTS code uses 30.

In general, taking full advantage of the vector register set improves
performance, and the trend has very much been towards using more registers --
not fewer.  (And the registers have been getting larger too!)  AES by itself
tends to need about 8 registers to take advantage of the CPU's full AES
throughput, but there are other computations like GHASH or tweak computation
that need to be interleaved with AES, using more registers.  And various
constants and round keys can be cached in registers to improve performance.

If we had to save/restore a large number of vector registers in every crypto
function call (not amortized to one save/restore per return to userspace), that
would be a big performance problem.

Most of the crypto code certainly could be written to use fewer registers.  But
it would reduce performance, especially if we tried to squeeze it down to use a
really small number of registers like 2-4.  Plus any such efforts would
complicate efforts to port crypto code between the kernel and userspace, as
userspace does not have such constraints on the number of registers.
