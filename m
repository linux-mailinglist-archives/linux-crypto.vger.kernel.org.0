For one thing, CRC-32 is not keyed so I don't see how you would use it as a=
 MAC?
It's also not a cryptographic hash function as the output is biased.

And it's true GHASH by itself is not a good MAC as you can recover the key,=
 but
that is easily solved by encrypting the tag with a one-time pad. Which, adm=
ittedly,
is not included in the GHASH definition itself, which makes it rather oddba=
ll as it
is also not a cryptographic hash function if the key is known.

Then again, does it have to be? You just mentioned CRC-32 being supported b=
y
the crypto API, which is also not a cryptographic construct ...

That sounds good as well. Although that would be the very last place I woul=

(and did) look.

Well, I had 2 possibilities: either everything was AAD or everything was ci=
phertext
and neither got matching results ... and then you go off into trying variou=
s byte=20
orders (9 our of 10 times it's just some endianess issue) and investigating=
 potential
bugs or limitations with the hardware itself. Of course this being crypto (=
and worse:=20
only getting a tag out of the hardware at the very end)  there's not a whol=
e lot of=20
information to work with. Basically only pass or fail. So yes, you quickly =
end up=20
wasting a lot of time.
I was NOT expecting ghash not to be GHASH as I know it, so it really was th=
e last=20
place to look.

>=20
I was about to make a remark stating that that's like saying a simple block=
 XOR=20
actually does implement AES counter mode (or ARC4 or Chacha20 or other rand=
om=20
stream cipher) correctly as long as you generate the key stream data block =
in a=20
particular way ...

And then I came across a 2007 NIST specification that defines GHASH exactly=
 as it's=20
implemented here, namely with all the formatting left out, just GHASH(K, X)=
.
I've always known GHASH the way Wikipedia defines it (which comes from the
original 2005 spec by McGrew and Viega), and that's also how our hardware=20
implements it (i.e. it cannot do GHASH without the padding and  the appende=
d=20
length word), but apparently there are different opinions out  there ... so=
 I stand=20
corrected?!
