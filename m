Well you could also use CRC-32 "as a MAC".  That doesn't actually make it a MAC.

I think a comment at the top of ghash-generic.c would be helpful, similar to the
one I wrote in nhpoly1305.c explaining that particular algorithm.

I'm surprised that you spent "days" debugging this, though.  Since the API gives
you a single data stream, surely you would have had to check at some point how
the two formal arguments (AAD, ciphertext) were encoded into it?  Were you just
passing the whole thing as the AAD or something?  Also to reiterate, it actually
does implement the GHASH algorithm correctly; the two formal parameters just
have to be encoded into the single data stream in a particular way.
