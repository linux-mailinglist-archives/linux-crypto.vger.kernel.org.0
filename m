But that is really the point. I don't *want* to be forced to disable
preemption in brand new code simply because some legacy highmem API
conflates being callable from atomic context with instantiating an
atomic context by disabling preemption for no good reason. IIUC, in
the past, you would really only call kmap_atomic() if you absolutely
had to, and so you would never rely on the preemption disabling
semantics accidentally. By making kmap_atomic() the preferred API even
for calls from non-atomic contexts, this line has blurred and we no
longer know why individual kmap_atomic() occurrences exist in the
first place.

I don't think we need to obsess about highmem, although we should
obviously take care not to regress its performance unnecessarily. What
I want to avoid is to burden a brand new subsystem with legacy highmem
baggage simply because we could not agree on how to avoid that.
