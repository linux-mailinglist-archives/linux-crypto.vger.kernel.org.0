The issue with your CCM patch is that it keeps the FPU enabled for the
entire input, which also means that preemption is disabled, which
makes the -rt people grumpy. (Of course, it also uses APIs that no
longer exists, but that should be easy to fix)

Do you happen to have any ballpark figures for the packet sizes and
the time spent doing encryption?
