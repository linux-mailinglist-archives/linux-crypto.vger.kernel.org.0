Ok, I'll send the next series with IRQ disabled. I don't see any difference on
my systems.

So I've currently 100 iterations. The first one or two iterations will be for
the warm-up (cache misses, branch prediction, etc). But with the interrupts
disabled, the rest of the iterations should give us enough stable measurements
for the benchmark. Maybe it would be worth to test the next version of teh
test on other platforms as well.
