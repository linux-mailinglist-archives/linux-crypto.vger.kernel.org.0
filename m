Yes. This is what I understood based on the code.

Right. Sorry for confusing you.

Yes. This is what I understood based on the code too.

The both cases looks like to get the larvals from the same list,
crypto_alg_list, one from crypto_larval_lookup() and the other from
__crypto_register_alg(). So I thought a single larval can be used at the
same time both at crypto_wait_for_test() and crypto_alg_mod_lookup() by
any chance. It would be great if the code ensures it never happens :-)

The problematic scenario I wanted to ask you looks like - I was
wondering if it's okay to nest requesting CRYPTO_MSG_ALG_REQUEST and
CRYPTO_MSG_ALG_REGISTER in a single stack, in other words, if it's okay
to try CRYPTO_MSG_ALG_REGISTER before completing CRYPTO_MSG_ALG_REQUEST.

A1 crypto_alg_mod_lookup()
A2    crypto_probing_notify(CRYPTO_MSG_ALG_REQUEST)
A3       cryptomgr_schedule_probe()
A4          kthread_run(cyptomgr_probe) ---> Start THREAD B

B1 cryptomgr_probe()
B2    pkcslpad_create()
B3       crypto_wait_for_test()
B4          crypto_probing_notify(CRYPTO_MSG_ALG_REGISTER)
B5             cryptomgr_schedule_test()
B6                kthread_run(cyptomgr_test) ---> Start THREAD C

C1 cryptomgr_test()
C2    crypto_alg_tested()
C3       complete_all(c) <- *the point* that I'd like to ask you.

A5    crypto_larval_wait()
A6       wait_for_completion_killable_timeout(c) /* waiting for B10 */
         (wake up and go)

Bx          wait_for_completion_killable(c) /* waiting for C3 */
            (wake up and go)
Bx    tmpl->alloc()
Bx    crupto_register_instance()
B10   complete_all(c)

I think I've shown you all the detail about the problematic flow. If
it still looks okay to you, then it'd be great!

Thank you,
Byungchul
