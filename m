Abuse... silly... either way, you're clearly not comfortable misusing
PRE_COPY for this purpose.

It's not really fine, but I think it will require some better defined
interfaces and userspace support to give a clear picture of how data is
partitioned.

It was only in v7 that we made this switch to use PRE_COPY for this
purpose, I wouldn't call it blowing up his series to step back and
decide that was a poor choice and clearly v8 exists without this.  This
isn't the end of the discussion regarding early compatibility testing,
but I'm not going to rush a PRE_COPY interface to support that early
compatibility testing if we're not agreed that it's a valid use case,
and not just a marginally acceptable one due to the trailing data being
inconsequential.  Let's focus on v8 and we can talk about further
extensions later.  Thanks,

Alex
