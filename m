The situation is not ideal, but I am not sure what we can do about
this: the scalar fallbacks are gone, which means that the SIMD unit
will be used in the test even if testmgr attempts to disable it. But
keeping the scalar fallbacks just for the test suite makes no sense
either. So I don't think we should change anything, other than perhaps
document this somewhere (any suggestions on a place to put that)

Note that the library routines, as well as shashes (which are
sometimes exposed via library routines, e.g., CRC-T10DIF and CRC-32,
and maybe others) are different, which is why their scalar fallbacks
are retained. There, we need the testmgr to override SIMD availability
to ensure that combinations of the SIMD and scalar code are tested.
