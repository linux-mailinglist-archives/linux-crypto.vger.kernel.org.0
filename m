Yes, I agree, and the kconfig options are already on my list of things to clean
up.  Thanks for giving your thoughts on how to do it.  To be clarify, this
initial set of changes removed the existing arch-specific CRC32 and CRC-T10DIF
options (on x86 that was CRYPTO_CRC32C_INTEL, CRYPTO_CRC32_PCLMUL, and
CRYPTO_CRCT10DIF_PCLMUL) and added the equivalent functionality to two choices
in lib, one of which already existed.  So for now the changes to the options
were just meant to consolidate them, not add to or remove from them per se.

I do think that to support kernel size minimization efforts we should continue
to allow omitting the arch-specific CRC code.  One of the CRC options, usually
CONFIG_CRC32, gets built into almost every kernel.  Some options already group
together multiple CRC variants (e.g. there are three different CRC32's), and
each can need multiple implementations targeting different instruction set
extensions (e.g. both PCLMULQDQ and VPCLMULQDQ on x86).  So it does add up.

But it makes sense to make the code be included by default, and make the choice
to omit it be conditional on CONFIG_EXPERT.

I'm also thinking of just doing a single option that affects all enabled CRC
variants, e.g. CRC_OPTIMIZATIONS instead of both CRC32_OPTIMIZATIONS and
CRC_T10DIF_OPTIMIZATIONS.  Let me know if you think that would be reasonable.

As you probably noticed, the other problem is that CRC32 has 4 generic
implementations: bit-by-bit, and slice by 1, 4, or 8 bytes.

Bit-by-bit is useless.  Slice by 4 and slice by 8 are too similar to have both.

It's not straightforward to choose between slice by 1 and slice by 4/8, though.
When benchmarking slice-by-n, a higher n will always be faster in
microbenchmarks (up to about n=16), but the required table size also increases
accordingly.  E.g., a slice-by-1 CRC32 uses a 1024-byte table, while slice-by-8
uses a 8192-byte table.  This table is accessed randomly, which is really bad on
the dcache, and can be really bad for performance in real world scenarios where
the system is bottlenecked on memory.

I'm tentatively planning to just say that slice-by-4 is a good enough compromise
and have that be the only generic CRC32 implementation.

But I need to try an interleaved implementation too, since it's possible that
could give the best of both worlds.
