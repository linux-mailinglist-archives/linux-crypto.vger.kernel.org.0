PK: Some context from my side which might clear up things
1. We have developed the SPAcc Crypto Linux driver for the Synopsys SPAcc I=
P.
2. Yes, this is technically a soft IP which we test on FPGA (Zynq
Ultrascale Boards).
3. We are NOT evaluating SPAcc IP and thus its not a custom use case
or a custom hardware.
4. Also SPAcc IP is NOT part of any SoC yet, but it may be in future.

Synopsys Semiconductor IP Business:
Synopsys develops Semiconductor IPs (aka DesignWare IPs) and provides
Linux device drivers to the SoC Vendors. We, as partners of Synopsys,
develop Linux device drivers for the IP, in this case SPAcc. So as of
now SPAcc is just a semiconductor IP which is not part of any SoC. A
3rd party SoC vendor would take this and integrate this as part of
their upcoming SoC.

SPAcc Semiconductor IP details:
https://www.synopsys.com/designware-ip/security-ip/security-protocol-accele=
rators.html

Synopsys DesignWare IPs
1. DWC MMC Host controller drivers : drivers/mmc/host/dw_mmc.c
2. DWC HSOTG Driver : drivers/usb/dwc2, drivers/usb/dwc3
3. DWC Ethernet driver : drivers/net/ethernet/synopsys
4. DWC DMA driver : drivers/dma/dw/

Intent of upstreaming IP drivers by Synopsys
1. As a Semiconductor IP designer, Synopsys provides Linux device
drivers with their IPs to the customers.
2. These Linux drivers handle all the configurations in those respective IP=
s.
3. At this stage of driver development, the focus is on the Semiconductor I=
P
4. Yes, the IP can be configured differently for different SoCs and
the driver has to take care of that.
5. The driver might need some enhancements based on the SoC
configurations, which could be done later.
6. Its a good approach to upstream IP drivers, so the vendors could
use/enhance the same open sourced drivers.

>
> I claim this cannot be used in a SoC without customization. If I

PK: Synopsys SPAcc is a highly configurable semiconductor IP. I agree
that it can be customized for the SoC vendors. But I dont understand
why it can't be used without SoC customizations for a default
configuration. All the IP customizations are handled by the driver.
Say, in the case of SPAcc, all the IP customizations are accessible as
part of the "Version" and "Version Extension-1, 2, 3" registers. So
the driver uses these IP customizations and nothing gets hardcoded. In
other cases, those customizations will come as vendor specific DT
properties.

As an IP, which can be memory mapped and with interrupt support, it
works perfectly with a default test configuration. And this is what
the current driver has.

PK: No, we are not evaluating, but we have developed a driver for
SPAcc, which has been tested on a FPGA.

PK: Its not an internal use case. We have tested the SPAcc driver on a
FPGA, as detailed above. We dont have any custom hardware and the
SPAcc IP is tested in a default configuration.

Question : Could you help me understand how a semiconductor IP vendor
like Synopsys, upstream Linux drivers for its IPs? In the current
scheme of things, if the SoC bindings are mandatory then we dont have
them at this stage. Those would have to come from the 3rd party SoC
vendors.

As a work around, I could add SPAcc bindings to Synopsys's "nsimosci".
Please let me know.
