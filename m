That's right... :-(

I fully understand this. This is not perfect, but at least it's the way
it is right now.

Yes, you either have to choice to put it in /lib/firmware (and in the
linux-firmwares project!) or to convince people to allow releasing this.

We can wait for others to hop in on the discussion, of course.

Thanks!
