We're in violent agreement.  I fully agree that, when allowed by the architecture,
injecting an error into the guest is preferable to killing the VM, which is in turn
preferable to crashing the host.

What I'm saying is that there are classes of bugs where injecting an error is not
allowed/feasible, and where killing an individual VM is not correct/feasible.

The canonical example of this escalating behavior is an uncorrectable ECC #MC.  If
the bad page is guest memory and the guest vCPU model supports MCA, then userspace
can inject an #MC into the guest so that the guest can take action and hopefully
not simply die.  If the bad page is in the guest but the guest doesn't support #MC
injection, the guest effectively gets killed.  And if the #MC is in host kernel
memory that can't be offlined, e.g. hits the IDT, then the whole system comes
crashing down.

For the record, we can make no such guarantees about the SNP VM.  Yes, the VM
_should_ do the right thing when handed a #VC, but bugs happen, otherwise we
wouldn't be having this discussion.
