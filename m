There's always the 'loglevel' command-line parameter, but yes, that
probably do not cover all cases.

I think what is an issue for me here is the re-use of a variable
intended to only control the version of the engine. And the way this
engine is probed/accessed has nothing to do with this.

One solution, that I think would work for both of us, would be to still
keep this information in .data (as you did) but to organise it within a
struct so that the version information is split from the way the device
is accessed. Would that work for you?

('version' can probably be a value and not a bitfield then).

I'm sorry if the discussion about this point seems disproportionate
compared to technical aspect, but I would like to avoid possible
maintenance issues in the future with conditions looking like:

  if (version == EIP197)

Which could easily be merged in a big patch but would break the
existing, given on what h/w the submitter tested the changes.

Feel free to send a patch later on :) (Even if it's only about the
comment, it is important as well).

Right.

You may also want to check for for helpers only defined if CONFIG_OF
is selected, as the driver could be compiled for a kernel with only
CONFIG_PCI enabled.

Thanks!
