Thanks for the insight. So I guess we have consensus that MORUS should
be removed. How about aegis128l and aegis256, which have been
disregarded in favor of aegis128 by CAESAR (note that I sent an
accelerated ARM/arm64 version of aegis128 based on the ARMv8 crypto
instructions, in case you missed it)
