That's unfortunate.  Surely Microsoft knows that md4 has been severely
compromised for over 25 years?  And md5 for 15 years.

Is the long-term plan to have everyone migrate to kerberos?  Currently kerberos
doesn't appear to be the default, so not many people actually use it -- right?

Well, maybe.  Even without kerberos, would it still be possible to use SMB with
a "guest" user only?

There is already an option CRYPTO_USER_API_ENABLE_OBSOLETE that could be
renamed and reused if we wanted to expand its scope to all insecure crypto.

Although a one-size-fits all kernel-wide option controlling "insecure" crypto
could be controversial, as there is no consensus whether some crypto algorithms
are secure or not, and different subsystems have different constraints.
