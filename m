Yes, wide-block modes such as Adiantum and HCTR2 require multiple passes over
the data.  As do SIV modes such as AES-GCM-SIV (though AES-GCM-SIV isn't yet
supported by the kernel, and it would be an "aead", not an "skcipher").

That makes sense, but I suppose this would mean adding code that allocates huge
scratch buffers, like what the infamous crypto/scompress.c does?  I hope that we
can ensure that these buffers are only allocated when they are actually needed.

Well, IV is *initialization vector*: a value that the algorithm uses as input.
It shouldn't be overloaded to represent some internal intermediate state.  We
already made this mistake with the iv vs. iv_out thing, which only ever got
implemented by CBC and CTR, and people repeatedly get confused by.  So we know
it technically works for those two algorithms, but not anything else.

With ChaCha, for example, it makes more sense to use 16-word state matrix as the
intermediate state instead of the 4-word "IV".  (See chacha_crypt().)
Especially for XChaCha, so that the HChaCha step doesn't need to be repeated.
