Absolutely, but it is the reality we have to live in.
It is actually an md4 hash wrapper inside a md5 hash so "better" but still...

I have no idea on the plans here.

Kerberos do require a bit of infrastructure to set up and manage, so a
keb5 only solution
would be a no-go for most/all home-nas environments and also all small
business "that is not
big enough to justify running a full ActiveDirectory environment."

For use, I would say that most larger domains and enterprises do use
AcriveDirectory and thus also Krb5 because of single signon and a
single account database.
But ActiveDirectory does require a fair amount of setup and management
so I think most smaller businesses and all home-NAS
users just use user/password NTLMSSP authentication.

What are the plans here? To just offer the possibility to disable all
these old crypto and hashes on a local kernel compile?
Or is the plan to just outright remove it from the kernel sources?

If the first, I think that could possible be done for cifs. I think a
lot of the security minded larger enterprises already may be disabling
both SMB1 and also NTLM on serverside, so they would be fine.

For the latter, I think it would be a no-go since aside from krb5
there are just no other viable authentication mechs for smb.

Yes and no.
In smb we actually have two different concepts of guest.
We have GUEST, where the SERVER decides you are a guest user, based on
some who-knows-what configuration
but you still authenticate properly (and have a session key).
and we have ANONYMOUS/NULL, where the client does not even have any
credentials at all (and you have no session key).

For the latest and most secure dialect of SMB 3.1.1 the command to
even map a share : SMB2 TREE_CONNECT
MUST be signed, and thus you have to have a session key, to sign it.
So, anonymous/null users can not even map a share without credentials.
Because they do not have a session key and thus can not
sign these command.

So in the case of no NTLMSSP, a user would technically be an ANONYMOUS
user, not a GUEST user.
The difference is subtle but important.   Technically a GUEST users
did authenticate properly, and got a SESSION KEY,
and logged in, but the server said "nah, you are GUEST".  But still,
the user got a session key.

Another huge drawback with anonymous/null/guest is that without a
properly authenticated session tied to a user account
you no longer have any meaningful ACL controls.   Which may be fine
for a home-NAS but not elsewhere.

There are no good solutions here.




TL;DR
If NTLMSSP authentication is disabled, there are no other options to
map a share than using KRB5
and setting up the krb5 infrastructure. And thus smaller sites will
not be able to use CIFS :-(
So while I think it is feasible to add support to cifs.ko to
conditionally disable features depending in a kernel compile (no SMB1
if des/rc4 is missing, no NTLM if rc4/md4/md5 is missing)  I don't
think it is feasible to disable these by default.
I will work on making it possible to build cifs.ko with limied
functionality when these algorithms are disabled though.
