Yes this is definitely a bug.

However, I think simply fixing this for test larvals is not enough.
After all, another thread could come through the middle and take
a reference to our newly minted algorithm before a subsequent
algorithm registration failure and thus would trigger exactly
the same crash.

So we need something a bit more general.  Previously we relied
on module reference counts to stop the unregistering of live
algorithms.  But that is clearly not of any use in this case.

It also fails for hardware devices than can be unplugged.

One solution would be to simply allow the unregistration to
continue and only free the data structures after all references
have gone away.

Cheers,
