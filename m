Hi Florian,

On some old kernels (though I think not all?), you can poll on
/dev/random. This isn't perfect, as the ancient "non blocking pool"
initialized after the "blocking pool", but it's not too imperfect
either. Take a look at the previously linked random-util.c.

I think all of this is yet another indication that there are some major
things to work out -- should we block or not? is buffering safe? is the
interface correct? -- and so we should just back out the arc4random
commit until this has been explored a bit more. We're not gaining
anything from rushing this, especially as a "source code compatibility"
thing, if there's not even agreement between OSes on what the function
does inside.

PS: please try to keep linux-crypto@vger.kernel.org CC'd. I've been
bouncing these manually when not, but it's hard to keep up with that.
