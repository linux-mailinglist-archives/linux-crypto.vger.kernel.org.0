The full structure of RFC4106 is the following:

- the key to be set is always 4 bytes larger than required for the respective 
AES operation (i.e. the key is 20, 28 or 36 bytes respectively). The key value 
contains the following information: key || first 4 bytes of the IV (note, the 
first 4 bytes of the IV are the bytes derived from the KDF invoked by IKE - 
i.e. they come from user space and are fixed)

- data block contains AAD || trailing 8 bytes of IV || plaintext or ciphertext 
- the trailing 8 bytes of the IV are the SPI which is updated for each new  
IPSec package

aead_request_set_ad points to the AAD plus the 8 bytes of IV in the use case 
of rfc4106(gcm(aes)) as part of IPSec.

Considering your question about the aead_request_set_ad vs 
aead_request_set_crypt I think the RFC4106 gives the answer: the IV is used in 
two locations considering that the IV is also the SPI in our case. If you see 
RFC 4106 chapter 3 you see the trailing 8 bytes of the IV as, well, the GCM IV 
(which is extended by the 4 byte salt as defined in chapter 4 that we provide 
with the trailing 4 bytes of the key). The kernel uses the SPI for this. In 
chapter 5 RFC4106 you see that the SP is however used as part of the AAD as 
well.

Bottom line: if you do not set the same IV value for both, the AAD and the GCM 
IV, you deviate from the use case of rfc4106(gcm(aes)) in IPSec. Yet, from a 
pure mathematical point of view and also from a cipher implementation point of 
view, it does not matter whether the AAD and the IV point to the same value - 
the implementation must always process that data. The result however will not 
be identical to the IPSec use case.

Some code to illustrate it - this code is from my CAVS test harness used to 
perform the crypto testing for FIPS 140-2:


Preparation of the key:

        /*
         * RFC4106 special handling: append the first 4 bytes of the IV to
         * the key. If IV is NULL, append NULL string (i.e. the fixed field is
         * zero in case of internal IV generation). The first 4 bytes of
         * the IV must be removed from the IV string.
         */
        if (strcasestr(ciphername, "rfc4106")) {
                struct buffer rfc;

                memset(&rfc, 0, sizeof(struct buffer));
                if (alloc_buf(data->key.len + 4, &rfc))
                        goto out;

                /* copy the key into buffer */
                memcpy(rfc.buf, data->key.buf, data->key.len);
                if (data->iv.len >= 4) {
                        uint32_t i = 0;

                        /* Copy first four bytes of the IV into key */
                        memcpy(rfc.buf + data->key.len, data->iv.buf, 4);

                        /* move remaining bytes to the front to be used as IV 
*/
                        for (i = 0; i < (data->iv.len - 4); i++)
                                data->iv.buf[i] = data->iv.buf[(i + 4)];
                        data->iv.len -= 4;
                }


Preparation of the SGL - the IV here is the trailing 8 bytes after the 
operation above:

        if (aead_assoc->len) {
                if (rfc4106) {
                        sg_init_table(sg, 3);
                        sg_set_buf(&sg[0], aead_assoc->data, aead_assoc->len);
                        sg_set_buf(&sg[1], iv->data, iv->len);
                        sg_set_buf(&sg[2], data->data, data->len +
                                (kccavs_test->type & TYPE_ENC ? authsize : 
0));
                } else {
                        sg_init_table(sg, 2);
                        sg_set_buf(&sg[0], aead_assoc->data, aead_assoc->len);
                        sg_set_buf(&sg[1], data->data, data->len +
                                (kccavs_test->type & TYPE_ENC ? authsize : 
0));
                }
        } else {
                if (rfc4106) {
                        sg_init_table(sg, 2);
                        sg_set_buf(&sg[0], iv->data, iv->len);
                        sg_set_buf(&sg[1], data->data, data->len +
                                (kccavs_test->type & TYPE_ENC ? authsize : 
0));
                } else {
                        sg_init_table(sg, 1);
                        sg_set_buf(&sg[0], data->data, data->len +
                                (kccavs_test->type & TYPE_ENC ? authsize : 
0));
                }
        }


Informing the kernel crypto API about the AAD size:

        if (rfc4106)
                aead_request_set_ad(req, aead_assoc->len + iv->len);
        else
                aead_request_set_ad(req, aead_assoc->len);


Set the buffers:

	aead_request_set_crypt(req, sg, sg, data->len, iv->data);

Ciao
Stephan
