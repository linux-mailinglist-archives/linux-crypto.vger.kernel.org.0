The skcipher and aead APIs do indeed need to work in softirq context.

It's possible to use a fallback, either by falling back to scalar instructions
or by punting the encryption/decryption operation to a workqueue using
crypto/simd.c.  However, both approaches have some significant disadvantages.
It was nice that the need for them on arm64 was eliminated by commit
13150149aa6ded.  Note that it's possible to yield the vector unit occasionally,
to keep preemption and softirqs from being disabled for too long.
