If you are going to place your driver through the Crypto API then
it needs to use the Crypto API interface for user-space access.
That interface is af_alg.

If this is not a good fit then I suggest that you move your API
elsewhere, perhaps to the powerpc tree where the user-space API can
then be properly reviewed.

It is not feasible to review your driver's user-space API through
the crypto tree.

The af_alg interface does not operate in the manner that you
describe.  It is an interface that maps onto the underlying kernel
Crypto API operations.  We currently don't have an af_alg module
for compression, but if we did we would be closely following the
current kernel compression interface.

One key feature of af_alg is that it normally is agnostic to the
underlying implementation.  That is, even when the hardware is
absent it would seamlessly switch over to a software implementation.

I say normally because there can be exceptions, e.g., with paes
and hardware keys.
