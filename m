OK, so the undocumented assumption is that algif_skcipher requests are
delineated by ALG_SET_IV commands, and that anything that gets sent to
the socket in between should be treated as a single request, right? I
think that makes sense, but do note that this deviates from Stephan's
use case, where the ciphertext stealing block swap was applied after
every call into af_alg, with the IV being inherited from one request
to the next. I think that case was invalid to begin with, I just hope
no other use cases exist where this unspecified behavior is being
relied upon.

Fair enough.
