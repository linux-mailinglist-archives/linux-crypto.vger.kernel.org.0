I agree that XTS should be preferred. But for some reason, the
kernel's XTS implementation does not support ciphertext stealing (as
opposed to, e.g., OpenSSL), and so CBC ended up being used for
encrypting the filenames in fscrypt.

I am trying to serve both customers with the same solution here,
regardless of whether it is the recommended approach or not.

True. But we don't have the proper abstractions to make this
distinction, and so a shash is currently the best match.

OK, that is helpful, thanks. Mind if I ping you once we reach a state
where we need to test for correctness? At the moment, this is still
mostly a discussion piece.
