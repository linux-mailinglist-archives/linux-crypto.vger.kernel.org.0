Right thanks for reminding me, I had forgotten about the first RFCs.

I don't understand the difference between vfio-mdev and uacce in this
context. An example may help. If you want to give direct access of a bit
of hardware to userspace, you necessarily need to isolate any resource
associated to that partition from other processes and from the kernel.
Namely create a DMA address space (SVA or AUXD), allocate an MMIO frame
and an interrupt (although IRQs are still handled by the kernel and could
be shared). And then you need to release those resources back into the
pool when the process exits or crashes.

There is DPDK, that implements userspace drivers for net and crypto using
vfio-pci, and will likely gain support for vfio-mdev soon. However
similarly to Qemu they are self-contained and can easily deal with the
fork problem, unlike a decompression library for example, that could be
included by any application.

In any case I agree with your point 1. that a simpler user interface might
be beneficial. Perhaps DPDK could support uacce as well later.

Thanks,
Jean
