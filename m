I agree, that's most likely a good default.

I think a global control would be good for testing, it seems simpler and
easier all round.  The per thing tuning seems more useful for cases
where we run into something like a performance reason to use a limited
set of vector lengths but I think we should only add that when we have
at least one user for it, some examples of actual restrictions we want
would probably be helpful for designing the interface.

Definitely worth exploring.
