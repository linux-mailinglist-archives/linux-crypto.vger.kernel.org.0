The ICE hardware cannot work without 'iface' clock and the power domain, which
are shared with the UFS PHY. One can argue that ICE is actually a part of the
peripherals like UFS/eMMC, but I don't have access to internal layout, so cannot
comment on that. I ran into this issue today when I tried to rmmod ice driver
together with ufs_qcom driver and got SError when reloading the module because
ice driver was trying to access unclocked/unpowered register.

But you should mark the resources as 'required' in the binding and justify the
ABI break. No need to preserve backwards compatibility here as the binding was
wrong from day one.

And you sent the fix after almost 2 years. Atleast I'm happy that you got around
to fix it.
