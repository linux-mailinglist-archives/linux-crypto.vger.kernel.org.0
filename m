In my ML-KEM code, all the decapsulation memory is consolidated into
struct mlkem_decap_workspace.  It would be straightforward to support
the caller providing a pre-allocated workspace.

In the case of X-Wing, we could also support pre-expanding the
decapsulation key.

It just depends on what is actually going to be needed by the kernel
feature(s) that are going to use this.  Which we don't really know yet.

We do know that it hasn't been found to be useful for the crypto
subsystem to provide pools for any other algorithm in the kernel, for a
variety of reasons.  Usually callers can just allocate per-operation, or
they have some sort of object (inode, block device, socket, etc.) that's
a natural place for them to cache whatever they need anyway.  In the
rare cases where some sort of pool is needed it's implemented in the
caller, optimized for the particular use case.  So I think there's a
good chance your pool idea is going off on the wrong track.

We don't need crypto_kpp support, as it's much more complex and harder
to use than the crypto library
(https://docs.kernel.org/crypto/libcrypto.html).  Also it seems it's not
really possible anyway, since crypto_kpp is an old design that works for
Diffie-Hellman but not KEMs.
