For MD5 message signing and NTLMv2, this series keeps the fips_enabled
checks where they were before.  That is, they're inserted where the
calls to cifs_alloc_hash() were before.  I think moving them to earlier
locations is best done in later patches, as it's not obvious (at least
to me) exactly how to do that.

I spent a while reading the code again, and this is what I came up with:

- For MD5 message signing: cifs_enable_signing() is probably the right
  place to disallow it.  However, it's called regardless of the signing
  algorithm.  So it needs a parameter passed in that tells it that the
  signing algorithm will be MD5 (or equivalently the dialect is SMB1).

- For NTLMv2: select_sec() and SMB2_select_sec() are where the
  authentication protocol is selected and are probably the right places
  to disallow NTLMv2 and RawNTLMSSP.  However, those are two places, not
  one.  We'd have to remember to put the fips_enabled check in both.

The nice thing about keeping the fips_enabled checks next to the actual
uses of the algorithms is that it ensures they stay in sync.  So maybe
we should just stay with that here.

- Eric
