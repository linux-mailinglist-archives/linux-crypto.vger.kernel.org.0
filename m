I think up to 190µs in interrupt can result in unwanted latencies. Yes it does not
happen that often and it is smaller than most timeslices of hypervisors.
So I would likely turn that question around
what happens if we return false if in_hardirq is true? Any noticeable
delays in code that uses random numbers?
