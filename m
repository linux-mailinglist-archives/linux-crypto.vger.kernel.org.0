Thanks, I will fix this.

This change is just in case we introduce any more flags in
future that we may not wish to pass along (as this code knows
nothing about it).

WEAK_KEYS is only defined for setkey.  Only MAY_SLEEP and MAY_BACKLOG
are currently meaningful for encryption and decryption.

EBUSY signals to the caller that it must back off and not issue
any more requests.  The caller should wait for a completion call
with EINPROGRESS to indicate that it may issue new requests.

For xts we essentially ignore EBUSY at this point, and assume that
if our own caller issued any more requests it would directly get
an EBUSY which should be sufficient to avoid total collapse.
