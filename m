The cap is kernel-private, but in arm64_ftr_bits the field was marked
FTR_VISIBLE, which means the field is exposed to userspace and VMs via
ID register emulation.

You're right that we'll warn (due to the STRICT mask), but I think that
given we're fairly certain we'll see mismatched systems, we should
handle that now rather than punt it a few months down the line.

Early in the boot process you can use this_cpu_has_cap(). My suggestion
was to have an explicit point (e.g. somewhere in setup_arch(), or an
initcall), were we check that and seed entropy on the boot CPU if
possible.

Can we refactor things so that early-on (at rand_initialize() time), we
call a different arch helper, e.g. a new arch_get_early_random*()?

Then that could do the this_cpu_has_cap() check to initialize things,
and at runtime we cna rely on the system-wide cap.

As above, I think that we an be fairly certain we're going to encounter
such systems, and it's going to be more painful to retrofit support
later (e.g. as we'll have to backport that), so I'd rather we handle
that up-front.

Thanks,
Mark.
