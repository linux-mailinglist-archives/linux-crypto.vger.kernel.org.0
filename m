We have to place restrictions on what cases
!(flags & CRYPTO_ALG_ALLOCATES_MEMORY) applies to anyway; see the patch that
introduces it.  If needed we could add more restrictions, like limit the number
of scatterlist elements.  If we did that, the driver could allocate memory if
the number of scatterlist elements is large, without having to set
CRYPTO_ALG_ALLOCATES_MEMORY.

Also, have you considered using a mempool?  A mempool allows allocations without
a possibility of failure, at the cost of pre-allocations.
