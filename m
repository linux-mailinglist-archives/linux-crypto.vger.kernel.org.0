Because you can only change the type of an expression by casting, and
an lvalue is not an expression. A variable has a type already, and you
cannot cast that away - what would that mean, exactly? Would all
occurrences of some_u32_array[] suddenly have a different type? Or
only element [3]?

You need to cast the right hand side, not the left hand side. If
some_u32_array is u32[], force cast it to (__force u32)

But *which* API? The skcipher API uses u8[] for in/output and keys,
and how these byte arrays are interpreted is not (and cannot) be
defined at this level of abstraction.

I agree that not all specs are crystal clear on this. But it is still
the algorithm that needs to define this.
