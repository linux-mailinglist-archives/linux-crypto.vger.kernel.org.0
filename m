No, it really isn't, and I am tired of having another endless debate about this.

C permits casting of expressions, not of lvalues.

So what exactly are you suggesting? That the skcipher API should
specify that the key is u8[], unless the algo in question operates on
32-bit words, in which case it is le32[], unless the algo in question
operates on 64-bit words, in which case it is le64[] etc etc? Do you
seriously think that at the skcipher API level we should mandate all
of that? That is insane.

Of course. But that is not the point. The skcipher API cannot possibly
reason about byte orders of all current and future algorithms that it
may ever encapsulate.
