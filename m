One of the things to consider with separate hardware block
implementation vis a vis CPU instruction based ones in general is that
often the consideration is more about getting a good enough
performance while freeing the CPU to perform other tasks which results
in better overall system performance rather than getting the best
possible performance in the specific task at hand. This is sometimes
further extended with power considerations where you can get better
power consumption when the lower performance  engine is used.
Less often, a lower jitter is more important than the peak
performance. I've seen this with encrypted video decoding for example.

Sadly, whether any of these considerations is applicable is very much
system and work load specific.

So my 2c contribution would be to include support for this, even if
not make this the default.
