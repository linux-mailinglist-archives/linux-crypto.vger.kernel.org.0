The problem with 'fixing' ecb(arc4) is that it will make it less
secure than it already is. For instance, imagine two peers using the
generic ecb(arc4) implementation, and using a pair of skcipher TFMs to
en/decrypt the communication between them, similar to how the WEP code
works today. if we 'fix' the implementation, every request will be
served from the same initial state (including the key), and therefore
reuse the same keystream, resulting in catastrophic failure. (Of
course, the code should set a different key for each request anyway,
but failure to do so does not result in the same security fail with
the current implementation)

So the problem is really that the lack of a key vs IV distinction in
ARC4 means that it does not fit the skcipher model cleanly, and
issuing more than a single request without an intermediate setkey()
operation should be forbidden in any case.

The reason I suggested removing it is that we really have no use for
it in the kernel, and the only known af_alg users are dubious as well,
and so we'd be much better off simply getting rid of ecb(arc4)
entirely, not because any of the implementations are flawed, but
simply because I don't think we should waste more time on it in
general.
