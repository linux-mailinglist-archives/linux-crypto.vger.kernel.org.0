I'd love to do that; it's what I did in fsverity.  Someone did intentionally
convert dm-verity from shash to ahash in 2017, though; see commit d1ac3ff008fb.
So we'd be reverting that.  Maybe there are people who'd still care.  Maybe not.
I haven't yet gotten any complaints about switching fsverity to shash in v6.5
(and I only used ahash originally because of the precedent of dm-verity).

Do you have in mind making struct ahash_request specify the data by either
scatterlist or by virtual address?  It might be possible.  It would be necessary
to wire up all possible combinations of (SG, virt) x (ahash_alg, shash_alg),
with the vmalloc_to_page() hack for the virt + ahash_alg case.

Well, struct shash_desc used to have that flag, but it never did anything.  The
few use cases like this might be more simply served by just having a helper
function crypto_shash_update_large() that passes the data in chunks to
crypto_shash_update().
