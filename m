The current approach uses build time dependencies - i.e., if you
decide to build the accelerated implementation, you always have to
load it, even if the accelerated implementation cannot be used on the
system in question, and it is up to that code to use fallbacks for
everything, This was kind of a compromise on my part when we were
having the crypto library vs Wireguard discussion - I mentioned at the
time that [in my opinion] it was a temporary approach because static
call support was taking so long to arrive. (lwn article here [0] but
the links in it seem to be dead). It also results in some nasty
Kconfig dependencies because building the generic code into the kernel
and building the accelerated code as a module gives problems.

I agree that having different approaches for doing the same thing is
suboptimal, but I think the situation may be slightly different for
plain SIMD code such as blake2 and poly1305 versus crc implementations
based on carryless multiplication instructions which may be rare but
10-20x faster if they are supported.

So in summary, I think this approach is better. The generic code can
be built in and superseded by module code, and there are no
dependencies going both ways.

There are some complications as well, though:
- module softdeps don't work {afaik) if the depender is builtin
- our poly1305 implementations use a different layout for the state
that is passed between the init/update/final calls, so it may be
tricky to use a similar approach there.
