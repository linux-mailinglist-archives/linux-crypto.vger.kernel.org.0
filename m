Yes, I agree. After debugging it yesterday along with a similar but
not identical issue with the help of Geert it's a bug in the driver
and will send a fix to the root cause shortly.

<rant>
However while working on debugging this it became obvious to me how
convoluted are the requirements for what to expect from the source
scatterlist of an AEAD request from the transformation provider driver
point of view:

- The source is presumed to have enough room for both the associated
data and the plaintext.
- Unless it's in-place encryption, in which case, you also presume to
have room for the authentication tag
- The only way to tell if this is in-place encryption or not is to
compare the pointers to the source and destination - there is no flag.
- Also, if we happen to be dealing with RFC 4106, you also need to
presume to have room for the IV.
- You can count on the scattergather list not having  a first NULL
buffer, *unless* the plaintext and associated data length are both
zero AND it's not in place encryption.
- You can count on not getting NULL as a scatterlist point, *unless*
the plaintext and associated data length are both zero AND it's not in
place encryption. (I'm actually unsure of this one?)
- The behavior of mapping scattergather lists is dependent on the
architecture, platform and configuration - e.g. even turning on
scatterlist DMA mapping debug option did not detect the issue that
Geert is seeing on his arm64 board that do not appear in mine...

So it's no wonder in a sense we got it wrong and judging from some of
the commits for the other driver maintainer I'm not the only one.

I'm not sure there is something actionable here, maybe just clearer
documentation' but it is feel a somewhat brittle API to implement from
a security hardware driver perspective.

Oh well...

Thank you all for your help!
