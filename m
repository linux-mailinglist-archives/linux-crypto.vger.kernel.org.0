BTW: Eric, thx for this.

Boris, Arnaud, Srujana, and Mikulas, could you maybe comment on this? I
understand that this is not some everyday regression due to deadlock
risk, but it nevertheless would be good to get this resolved somehow to
stay in line with our "no regressions" rule.

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)
