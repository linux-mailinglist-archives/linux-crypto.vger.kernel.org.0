Subject: [PATCH v2 0/7] crypto: caam - IOMMU support

This patch set adds support in caam drivers (caam/jr, caam/qi, caam/qi2)
for the crypto engine to work behind an IOMMU.

v2:
Fixed compilation warnings (unused variables) in patch 3/7.

v1:

The changes consist in:

1. Deferred probing support
-caam/jr - top level drivers are converted to "libraries"; this also fixes
the issue reported previously by Marcin:
https://patchwork.kernel.org/cover/10558409/
-caam/qi - use the newly added QBMan functions (*) to decide whether to defer
caam controller probing or not

2. Fixing spurios memory accesses, that lead to IOMMU access faults
-crypto engine prefetches S/G table entries in chunks of 4 (64 bytes),
and driver has to make sure memory is allocated and mapped
-crypto engine tries to prefetch S/G table entries when input / output
is marked as scattered, even though length is zero

3. Getting rid of platform device created by caam/qi
There are inherent problems with platform device being created dynamically
(and not relying on the existence of a DT node).

4. Update phys -> virt address translation in case IOMMU is present
iova -> phys -> virt

5. Fix the device used for key buffers DMA mapping
Key buffers are incorrectly DMA mapped using a job ring device, since they
are accessed eventually by the QI - this creating an ICID / stream ID
mismatch at IOMMU level.

Tests were performed on:
-LS1046A - caam/jr and caam/qi - job ring and queue interface
-LS1088A - caam/jr and caam/qi2 - job ring and dpsec interface

There are some dependencies (see below).
While not everything is in place, I would like at least to patches 1-6/7
being reviewed & merged.

i. Patch 7/7 (crypto: caam - defer probing until QMan is available) depends
on commit 1c8f39946c03 ("soc: fsl: qbman_portals: add APIs to retrieve the probing status")
from Leo's tree: git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/leo/linux.git
and should not be merged.

ii. U-boot updates for LS1088A (needed for caam/jr ICID programming)
[U-Boot,1/2] armv8: fsl-layerscape: add missing sec jr base address defines
https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/1059256/
[U-Boot,2/2] armv8: ls1088a: add icid setup for platform devices
https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/1059259/

Horia GeantÄƒ (7):
  crypto: caam - avoid S/G table fetching for AEAD zero-length output
  crypto: caam - fix S/G table passing page boundary
  crypto: caam - convert top level drivers to libraries
  crypto: caam/qi - don't allocate an extra platform device
  crypto: caam/qi - fix address translations with IOMMU enabled
  crypto: caam/qi - DMA map keys using proper device
  crypto: caam - defer probing until QMan is available
