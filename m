Having a random vector length could be good for testing ;)

I was tempted to add that as a deliberate feature, but that sort of
nothing doesn't really belong in the kernel...


Anyway:

The main reasons for constraining the vector length are a) to hide
mismatches between CPUs in heterogeneous systems, b) to ensure that
validated software doesn't run with a vector length it wasn't validated
for, and c) testing.

For kernel code, it's reasonable to say that all code should be vector-
length agnostic unless there's a really good reason not to be.  So we
may not care too much about (b).

In that case, just setting ZCR_EL1.LEN to max in kernel_sve_begin() (or
whatever) probably makes sense.

For (c), it might be useful to have a command-line parameter or debugfs
widget to constrain the vector length for kernel code; perhaps globally
or perhaps per driver or algo.


Otherwise, I agree that using SVE in the kernel _should_ probably work
safely, using the same basic mechanism as kernel_mode_neon().  Also,
it shouldn't have higher overheads than kernel-mode-NEON now.

Agreed

Nonetheless, working up a candidate algorithm to help us see whether
there is a good use case seems like a worthwhile project, so I don't
want to discourage that too much.
