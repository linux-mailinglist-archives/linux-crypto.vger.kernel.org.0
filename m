And I think we will need to tune down stdlib/tst-arc4random-thread internal
parameters because it now takes about 1 minute on my testing machine (which
is somewhat recent processor).  I will send a patch to adjust the maximum
number of threads depending of the configured system CPU (to avoid syscall
contention).
