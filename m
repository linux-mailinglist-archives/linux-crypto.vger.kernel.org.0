If you want some discussion, it would be very helpful if you cc device-mapper list
to reach dm-crypt developers. Please add at least dm-devel list.

Just a few comments:

 - ESSIV is useful only for CBC mode. I wish we move to some better mode
in the future instead of cementing CBC use... But if it helps people
to actually use unpredictable IV for CBC, it is the right approach.
(yes, I know XTS has own problems as well... but IMO that should be the default
for sector/fs-block encryption these days :)

- I do not think there is a problem if ESSIV moves to crypto API,
but there it is presented as a hash... It is really just an IV generator.

In cryptsetup testsuite, we test serpent and twofish ciphers at least, but in
reality, essiv(aes,sha256) is the most used combination.
If it makes sense, I can run some tests with dm-crypt and this patchset.

Thanks,
Milan
