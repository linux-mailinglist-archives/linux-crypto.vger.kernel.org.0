Fair enough. But it did involve making modifications to the generic
layer, since there are known users of the AF_ALG interface that may
pass zero length inputs (e.g., sha1sum).

I never said it was a corner case, nor does it make a lot of sense to
reason about fractional compliance, given that 100% of the inputs we
ever encounter are covered by your 6.25% of legal input data.

What i did say was that the moving parts we will add to the code will
never be put into motion, while they do increase the validation space,
and so the value of the contribution will be negative.

Perhaps I should emphasize that my concern is mainly about in-kernel
usage of the sync software ciphers, since they typically have no use
for userland, given that they can simply issue the same instructions
directly. For AF_ALG, I agree that exposing a non-compliant XTS
implementation is a bad idea.

I really don't care what we call it. My point is that we don't need
functionality that we will not use, regardless of how it is called.

I think it was premature optimization that is the root of all evil, no?
