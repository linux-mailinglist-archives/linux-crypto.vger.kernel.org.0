Ha!  I belatedly see your point: in the end, virtualized KL would also rely on a
trusted entity to isolate its sensitive data via paging-like mechanisms.

The difference in my mind is that encryption is a means to an end for SGX,
whereas hiding the key is the entire point of KL.  E.g. the guest is already
relying on the VMM to isolate its code and data, adding KL doesn't change that.
Sharing an IWKEY across multiple guests would add intra-VM protection, at the
cost of making cross-VM attacks easier to some degree.
