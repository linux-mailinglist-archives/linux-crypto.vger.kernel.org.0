Tcrypt does not do any testing, it simply allocates the ciphers to ensure that
the self tests defined in testmgr are executed.

If tcrypt is loaded as one of the first steps in user space boot, the self
tests are executed before any algo is put to use.

Search for all RHEL/SLES/Ubuntu CMVP kernel validations.

The key is in the dracut component:

What I mean is that with 140-3 the current kernel behavior of invoking the
testmgr during the first-time allocation of an algorithm is sufficient without
any changes to the current code.

Yes, user space controls it, but not the user. It is hard-wired into the boot
process.

Not sure how it can be too late if it is one of the first steps in the user
space boot.

Check the dracut approach - there you have your selection ability.
