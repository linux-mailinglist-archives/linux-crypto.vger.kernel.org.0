I said its lost if there is no Secure World (which IMHO is still a valid
case). I mean if its already the BootROM which assign it 
(unconditionally)
and there will be no secure world later in the boot process, then its 
lost.

But this would also be possible if the JR is only acquired later by
TF-A (or optee), no?

I've noticed that too, but then assumed that because TZ_PRIM=1 implies
TZ_OWN=1 and the lock bit will lock TZ_PRIM then TZ_OWN must also be 1.
But that's not the case for LS SoCs.

I don't have access to the IMX8M SEC right now. If memory serves 
correctly,
I just saw that on an overview. But I just had a look at the 
LS1028ASECRM,
and there is "SEC's Job Ring interface can be independently assigned
(and re-assigned) to different users." (ch 12.2).

Sure, but it will also be the other way around, no? Like S world can
"steal" the JR from NS world. And thats what I'm worried about.

To be clear, I don't talk about dynamic behavior here. Just try to
determine where the JR should be disabled/removed from the DT. And
I'm assuming a static partition of the JRs between S and NS world.

To recap, NXP suggested to disabled it in the SoC dtsi in
u-boot. This depends on whether the BootROM actually assignes
it to S worlds and there is no way for u-boot to regain access
(assuming that u-boot or u-boot SPL will be started in EL3). If
it is not possible to reassign it to NS world, then the JR should
be disabled in linux and u-boot DTs. If there is a chance to
regain control and that there might be no TF-A at all, then
statically disable the JR in u-boot is wrong. Instead it should
be determined at runtime (again just static partitioning, no
dynamic reassignment).

I had a fixup at runtime of the DT (both the active DT in
u-boot as well as the DT passed from u-boot to linux) in
mind. Check the TZ_OWN bit and remove/disable the JR.

There is also an ongoing discussion where and how the DT will
be passed to u-boot and linux. So I might be the case that
TF-A will allocate one JR to itself and just pass u-boot the
DT where that JR is disabled or removed. Which might also
fit the "fixup" in u-boot.

Ok, then u-boot should be able to reset the JR to its defaults
if its started in EL3 (and there is no TF-A at all), right?
