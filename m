There's a known bug when the extra self-tests are enabled, where the first
allocation of an algorithm actually returns the generic implementation, not the
highest priority implementation.  See:
https://lkml.kernel.org/linux-crypto/20190409181608.GA122471@gmail.com/
Does that explain what you saw?

Is this reproducible without any local patches?  If so, can you provide clear
reproduction steps?
