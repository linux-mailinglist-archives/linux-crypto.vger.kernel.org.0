[Resend with CC linux-crypto]

I recently upgraded my Sun T5120 the kernel to 5.19.12. The first thing I 
noticed afterwards was that the boot took nearly one hour and spewed lots of 
warnings about crng_init=0. As a workaround I did that:

# grep -n quality /usr/src/linux/drivers/char/hw_random/n2-drv.c 
770:    np->hwrng.quality = 5;

This has solved the issue for me, boot is now down to ~2min again. I wonder if 
I'm missing something obvious like another driver that I should activate?

Then I noticed that the hw crypto support from drivers/crypto/n2_core.c fails 
to load with -EINVAL. From looking at the code I think this is because 
statesize is not set for the hash algorithms, so registering the first one 
(md5) fails and nothing else is tried. I then set NUM_HASH_TMPLS to 0 so they 
were never attempted, which resulted in the second loop succeeding:

[   40.561230] n2_crypto: n2_crypto.c:v0.2 (July 28, 2011)
[   40.561361] n2_crypto: Found N2CP at /virtual-devices@100/n2cp@7
[   40.561506] n2_crypto: Registered NCS HVAPI version 2.0
[   40.562493] n2_crypto: ecb(des) alg registered
[   40.562567] n2_crypto: cbc(des) alg registered
[   40.562687] n2_crypto: cfb(des) alg registered
[   40.562760] n2_crypto: ecb(des3_ede) alg registered
[   40.562833] n2_crypto: cbc(des3_ede) alg registered

[   40.563007] n2_crypto: ecb(aes) alg registered
[   40.563084] n2_crypto: cbc(aes) alg registered
[   40.563156] n2_crypto: ctr(aes) alg registered
[   40.563890] n2_crypto: Found NCP at /virtual-devices@100/ncp@6

Maybe someone with the knowledge about the right statesize could send a patch? 
I'm open for testing. This is probably broken for a very long time, i.e. 
8996eafdcbad149ac0f772fb1649fbb75c482a6a (kernel v4.3).

Greetings,
