I think only the NUMA node is the problem, not the memcg.

Oh shoot. Yeah I missed that part.

In the past, we sort of did not care - zswap was very poorly designed
for NUMA architecture in general, and most of our test setups have
been single-node, so these kinds of discrepancies did not show up in
performance numbers.

But we are getting more multi-node systems:

1. Bigger hosts (memory-wise) tend to also have more than one nodes.
It scales better that way (especially because a lot of structures and
locks protecting them are node-partitioned).

2. We have also seen different memory media that are often expressed
to the kernel as nodes: CXL, GPU memory, etc.

This will necessitate tightening memory placement. We recently had to
fix one such issue:

https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/56e5a103a721d0ef139bba7ff3d3ada6c8=
217d5b

So I'm a bit nervous about this change, which will make us use the wrong LR=
U...

Some work around:

1. Can we squeeze an extra int field anywhere in struct zswap_entry?

2. Can we pump nid all the way to zswap_lru_add()?

This is still not 100% ideal - the metadata (struct zswap_entry) will
still be allocated on the wrong node. But at least the data are
properly managed, i.e on the right LRU.

I agree. This seems troubling.

What's the variance of your benchmark results, Kanchana? I have found
that kernel build tests can have quite a bit of variance, but is it as
big as the performance difference of these minor changes (i.e, can it
explain the "regression")?

Agree. These micro-optimizations seem very fragile.
