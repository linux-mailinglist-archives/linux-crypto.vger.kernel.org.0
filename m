OK.

For the record, the reason is that, even though kernel_neon_begin/end
are reasonably cheap these days, the common case for CCM (given its
use in networking context) is for the auth/encrypt/finalize routines
to each be called a single time, without any potentially sleeping
calls into the skcipher walk layer in between. Now that we are doing
more work in there (disable softirq processing as well as preemption),
it was a suitable occasion to do some refactoring that I have had on
my list for a while now.
