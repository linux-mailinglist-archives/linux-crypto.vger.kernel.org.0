Yes, this can be calculated from the original expression.

My original approach is to multiply the byte sequence with the **decreasing**
sequence. I think the increasing sequence here is more friendly to the trailing
bytes of the loop.:-)

When I actually tested this code, I found that the byte length of the
test must be equal to the vector length divided by 4 (that is, an integer
multiple of the number of words in the SVE) and the result is correct.

And I think one of the reasons is that the value stored in zV.s needs to be
changed in the last cycle. It should be changed to the actual number of
bytes remaining in the last cycle. :)

In order to verify my conjecture, I added a bit of code to here, which is to
subtract the corresponding value from zV in the last loop. But it is correct
only when the number of bytes is less than one cycle. Test cases that exceed
one complete cycle will also fail.

So I guess before calculating the last cycle, zA should be summed first,
because before the end of the cycle, zA and zB are scattered in the elements
of the vector, if the last cycle calculates zB, only part of zA is summed
( Because pP/m does not count inactive elements), it should be incomplete.

This is just my guess and has not yet been verified.:)

The code you sent me provides a correct way to deal with trailing bytes,
I need to spend some more time to debug the problem encountered above.
Thank you!
