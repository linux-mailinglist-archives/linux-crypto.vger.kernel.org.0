Hello,

Since our previous discussion, I have significantly updated the
userspace implementation and completed a series of benchmarks and
validation tests.

The implementation allocates all memory required for a given key
during key creation and subsequently operates entirely within that
preallocated memory until the key is destroyed.

During decapsulation, the same memory allocated at key creation is
reused across operations, eliminating runtime memory allocations in
the decapsulation path.


I compared the implementation against PQClean ML-KEM. The main observations=
 are:

* Stack usage remains approximately 1 KB regardless of the selected
ML-KEM security level.
* No memory allocations are performed during decapsulation.
* Throughput is generally comparable to PQClean.
* For ML-KEM-1024, the implementation is currently about 5=E2=80=938% slowe=
r
than PQClean.
* The trade-off is increased persistent memory consumption and a more
complex internal architecture based on reusable preallocated
resources.

I also took your earlier feedback into account and came to the
conclusion that integration through lib/crypto would be a better
direction than the KPP interface. As a result, I am now seriously
considering adapting the implementation for lib/crypto instead.

In addition, I am continuing to investigate further optimizations in
pure C. If these experiments produce meaningful results, I will
publish them and would be happy to share the findings in the future.

Benchmark results, methodology, stack usage measurements, memory usage
analysis, and PQClean comparisons are available here:

Release:
https://github.com/kstzv/ml-kem/releases/tag/v1.1.0

Benchmarks:
https://github.com/kstzv/ml-kem/tree/v1.1.0/portable/userspace/benchmarks

Thank you again for your earlier feedback.

Best regards,
K. S. Zavertailo
