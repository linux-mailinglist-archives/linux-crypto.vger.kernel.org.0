Valid? A totally fabricated case, if you ask me. Yes, you could do that,
but is it *useful* at all? Really?
No, it's not because a file of length 0 is a file of length 0, the length
in itself is sufficient guarantee of its contents. The hash does not add
*anything* in this case. It's a constant anyway, the same value for *any*
zero-length file. It doesn't tell you anything you didn't already know.
IMHO the tool should just return a message stating "hashing an empty file
does not make any sense at all ...".

Again, you could *theoretically* do that, but I don't know of any *practicl=
e*
use  case (protocol, application) where you can have *and* 0 length AAD *an=
d*
0 length payload (but do correct me when I'm wrong there!)
In any case, that would result in a value *only* depending on the key (same
thing applies to zero-length HMAC), which is likely some sort of security
risk anyway.

As I mentioned before, we made a lot of hashing and authentication hardware
over the past 20+ years that has never been capable of doing zero-length
operations and this has *never* proved to be a problem to *anyone*. Not a
single support question has *ever* been raised on the subject.

True, although that's also the least problematic case to handle.
Doing nothing at all is not so hard ...

Consistency should only be required for *legal* ranges of input parameters.
Which then obviously need to be properly specified somewhere.
It should be fair to put some reasonable restrictions on these inputs as to
not burden implementions with potentially difficult to handle fringe cases.

I fail to see the huge burden of the extra len>0 restriction.
Especially if you compare it to the burden of adding all the code for
handling such useless exception cases to all individual drivers.

I don't see how disallowing 0 length inputs would affect implementations th=

ARE capable of processing them. Unless you would require them to start
throwing errors for these cases, which I'm not suggesting.

For skciphers, yes, it's not such a problem. Neither for basic hash.
(And thanks for the code suggestion BTW, this will be a lot more efficient
then what I'm doing now for this particular case :-)
For HMAC, however, where you would have to return a value depending on the
key ... not so easy to solve. I don't have a solution for that yet :-(

And I'm pretty sure this affects all Inside Secure HW drivers in the tree:
inside-secure, amcc, mediatek and omap ...
