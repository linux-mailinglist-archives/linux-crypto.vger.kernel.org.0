We decided to use key descriptions so that we could identify more 
clearly devices managed by cryptsetup (thus 'cryptsetup:' prefix in our 
descriptions put in dm-crypt table). I understood numeric ids were too 
generic for this purpose. Also cryptsetup uses by default thread keyring 
to upload keys in kernel. Such keys are obsolete the moment cryptsetup 
process finishes.

I don't think it's any problem to go with IDs for your patch. IIUC, as 
long as process has permission to access key metadata it can obtain also 
current key id so it's not a big problem for as to adapt when we use kcapi.
