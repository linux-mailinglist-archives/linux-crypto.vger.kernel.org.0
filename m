Two statements above have raised at least one of my eyebrows.

1) France has laws that require backdoors.

2) France did not want GSM encryption.


The following article claims that it was the British who demanded that
A5/1 be weakened (not the algorithm, just the key size; which is what
the USgov did in the 90s).

As for your first claim, can you provide more information, so that I could
locate the law(s) in question? (Year the law was discussed, for example.)

I've seen a few propositions ("projet de loi") but none(?) have made it into
actual law, as far as I'm aware.
