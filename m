This doesn't make sense, since there are changes in this patch that are only in
the CRYPTOGAMS version, not in the OpenSSL 4dfe4310c31c version.

Each "Co-developed-by" always needs its own "Signed-off-by".

And this says it's taken from the OpenSSL project, not CRYPTOGAMS.

Also how is this copyright 2006?  The newest date in either the OpenSSL or
CRYPTOGAMS versions is March 2015.

Also, can you elaborate on what changes have been made from version actually
being used in production in OpenSSL, and how those changes were vetted?  You
keep claiming that this implementation is extremely well vetted in comparison to
the kernel's existing implementation, so presumably you have something in mind.
