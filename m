I think the cryptsetup release notes may have given you a slightly wrong
impression.  So far the only things that have been removed from AF_ALG
are zero-copy and async execution support, which have zero impact on
cryptsetup.  There are indeed more people turning off AF_ALG in their
kernels now; however, general-purpose distros aren't doing that.

In 7.3 we'll indeed be introducing an algorithm allowlist for AF_ALG.
But I already proposed including "xts(serpent)", "xts(twofish)", and
"xts(camellia)" on it
(https://lore.kernel.org/linux-crypto/20260705184419.40762-1-ebiggers@kernel.org/)
based on their mention in various online documentation for cryptsetup,
which suggests they indeed likely have some (rare) real-world use.

I'm interested in allowing any other algorithms that still have
real-world use via AF_ALG, if any exist.  If you're aware of any, please
speak up.  In particular, if you could confirm that the "xts(serpent)"
and "xts(twofish)" allowlist entries are necessary and sufficient for
you, that would be helpful.

Note that cryptsetup 2.8.7 will further reduce the cases in which it
even needs AF_ALG at all.  So just because you are using a particular
algorithm doesn't necessarily mean you need it in AF_ALG.

No algorithms have been proposed to be dropped from dm-crypt (which is
*not* the same thing as AF_ALG), by the way.  Given that dm-crypt allows
some "interesting" algorithms like RC4, DES-ECB, and even the null
cipher, I do think we can expect an allowlist for it at some point as
well.  But that would be separate.

I'd indeed like to remove AF_ALG entirely eventually.  But that's a long
term thing that would be many years from now and would occur only after
iwd, bluez, cryptsetup etc. have all fully migrated to userspace crypto.
