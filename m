Thank you for the detailed feedback and for outlining the historical
context regarding pools in the crypto subsystem.


I understand your point of view and the preference for keeping the
core implementation simple with per-operation allocations (or
caller-provided workspaces), especially given the lack of precedent
for pool-based designs in lib/crypto. My approach with the reusable
decapsulation pool was driven by a focus on constrained environments
where minimizing stack usage and relying on reusable preallocated
working memory during the hot path can be particularly valuable.
However, I fully agree that concrete data is needed to properly
evaluate the trade-offs.


I see your point regarding preallocated workspaces and caller-managed
caching. One of the goals of my prototype was to explore a design
where decapsulation operates on reusable preallocated contexts rather
than per-call working memory, primarily to reduce stack requirements
and move memory management into an initialization phase. I need to
analyze more carefully how much of this can already be achieved
through a caller-provided workspace model and whether the additional
complexity of a dedicated pool is actually justified.


I am currently working on benchmarks that compare stack consumption,
allocation behavior, memory footprint, and performance between the
different approaches. Once I have solid numbers, I will share the
results and my conclusions.


I also appreciate the clarification regarding KPP. My original
prototype used KPP because it appeared to be the closest existing
interface for key establishment, but I am not specifically attached to
that approach and will spend some time evaluating how the same ideas
could fit into the lib/crypto model as well. In the meantime, I will
also look into how the pre-allocated workspace support you suggested
could be integrated.


Best regards,
K. Zavertailo
