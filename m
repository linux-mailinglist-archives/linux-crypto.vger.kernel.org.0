I actually found the issue independently and came up with this patch
before Ard pointed me to his patch, I mainly took the description of the
problem from him, as his explanation was already well written.

Yes, this is intentional. The point is that __hsiphash_unaligned() is
the portable version that works with any alignment on any architecture,
while __hsiphash_aligned() is either identical, or may only be called
with aligned data. Passing an unaligned pointer into this function triggers
undefined behavior in C99, which is how it broke on armv7, but in fact
any compiler might optimize this function based on "knowing" that
the lower address bits are zero.

I have not tested this specific patch on all platforms, but I did
extensive testing of the get_unaligned()/put_unaligned() helpers
in my rewrite earlier this year[1], making sure that these are NOPs
on all the important architectures, and that they prevent the use
of trapping ldrd/ldm instructions on ARMv6/ARMv7.

Clang is actually doing the right thing here, it may be considered a missed
optimization that gcc uses two loads instead of a combined ldm or ldrd ;-)

FWIW, the bug that we saw in the decompressor relying on data alignment on x86
earlier this year only happened on gcc.
