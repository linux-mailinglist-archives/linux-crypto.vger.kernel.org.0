I think at a minimum we'd want to handle the vector length explicitly
for kernel mode SVE, vector length independent code will work most of
the time but at the very least it feels like a landmine waiting to cause
trouble.  If nothing else there's probably going to be cases where it
makes a difference for performance.  Other than that I'm not currently
seeing any issues since we're handling SVE in the same paths we handle
the rest of the FPSIMD stuff.

I tend to agree here, my concerns are around the cost of maintaining a
SVE implementation relative to the number of users who'd benefit from it
rather than around the basic idea of using SVE at all.  If we were
seeing substantial performance benefits over an implementation using
NEON, or had some other strong push to use SVE like a really solid
understanding of why SVE is a good fit for the algorithm but NEON isn't,
then it'd be worth finishing up the infrastructure.  The infrastructure
itself doesn't seem fundamentally problematic.
