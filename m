My point is not about the 1024 as an exact value, it's more about "do the
driver and the hardware really provide _something_ sensible or not". In the
past, the default mode as to feed the output of hw_rng devies to some
userspace daemon, which then tried to verify that the device works as
expected, and then feeded the data back to the crng core. This userspace
indirection is largely removed already (in particular by a patch of mine
which starts up the hwrng kernel thread also for devices with quality==0)
once the crng is fully initialized, on the rationale that even bad quality
data will do no harm. Yet, we may need to be a tad more careful whether or
not to trust devices for the initial seeding of the crng.

Thanks,
	Dominik
