This does sound like a DMA problem. I assume the accelerator is not
cache coherent?

In any case, it is dubious whether the round trip to the accelerator
is worth it when encrypting the GHASH key. Just call aes_encrypt()
instead, and do it in software.

Non-cache coherent DMA involves cache invalidation on inbound data. So
if both the device and the CPU write to the same cacheline while the
buffer is mapped for DMA from device to memory, one of the updates
gets lost.
