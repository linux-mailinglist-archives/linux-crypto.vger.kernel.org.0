You're right about this dependency. Do you meant guest_memfd THP support
for "2M hugepage"?

Yes, this is going to be implemented as part of the HugeTLB support
for guest_memfd. HugeTLB support for guest_memfd extends to any HugeTLB
page size the host supports, so not just 1G, 2M as well. :)

Ah okay. The kvm_arch_gmem_invalidate() call in .free_folio is the part
that updates the RMP table to make anything private become shared.

So the RMPOPT probably needs to happen after the invalidate in .free_folio

The RMPOPT stuff is still useful even if the host never uses huge pages
for guest_memfd, right? If so, I think we still need a solution
regardless of when huge page support for guest_memfd lands.

What if we do it this way: in .free_folio, after doing the invalidate,
take the pfn of the folio being freed, align that to the GB containing
that pfn, then RMPOPT that? This way there is no dependency on the inode
being around.

RMPOPT looks up the shared/private-ness of the page in the RMP table
anyway so as long as the RMP table is updated, we should be good?

The awkward part is if RMPOPT is run twice when the RMP table state
hasn't changed. Is my understanding right that there will be no
correctness issues, just performance?

We can perhaps optimize (away or otherwise) unnecessary RMPOPTs later?

With this aligning-up-to-the-GB, at least we're not iterating the entire
host memory.

Thank you!
