Hehe :)

I'd say you usually try not to send too many patches / series in
parallel. If that is not possible, or if you have series with
dependencies you can explain the dependency in the cover letter (just
try not to have 10's of series with dependencies in parallel).

Also if you have series not aimed to be merged right now but you want
comments, you can use [RFC] instead of [PATCH] in the object of the
mail.

This is usually working quite OK :)
