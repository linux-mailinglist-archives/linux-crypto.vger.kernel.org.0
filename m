Purgatory actually gets the generic SHA-256 code already.  The way it works is
that for purgatory lib/crypto/sha256.c is built with __DISABLE_EXPORTS defined,
and that file detects that and disables the arch-optimized code.  The
arch-optimized assembly code is not built into purgatory.

This isn't particularly hard to continue supporting, versus the alternative of
duplicating the generic SHA-256 code into a special file that's just for
purgatory.  5b90a779bc547 just made it unnecessarily fragile by relying on
compiler inlining to avoid a call to the arch-optimized code (which isn't built
into purgatory) from being generated.

My series
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-crypto/20250625070819.1496119-1-ebiggers@kernel.org/
makes it simpler and less fragile.  The #include of sha256-generic.c from
sha256.c goes away, and the selection of sha256_blocks() becomes just:

    #if defined(CONFIG_CRYPTO_LIB_SHA256_ARCH) && !defined(__DISABLE_EXPORTS)
    #include "sha256.h" /* $(SRCARCH)/sha256.h */
    #else
    #define sha256_blocks sha256_blocks_generic
    #endif

That patchset is targeting 6.17, though.  So we had to do this separate fix for
6.16 which has the odd sha256_choose_blocks() thing.
