Hi All,

Thanks for the thoughtful feedback, and apologies for the delayed reply.

1. Regarding Paolo's question, a bit more context about who we are.

I first got involved in the kernel community during undergrad with
guidance from Zhangjin Wu <falcon@tinylab.org>.
I started building VEGA earlier this year while I was a PhD student at
UC Riverside. I recently dropout and start a company called Nebula
Security with my labmates. We want to help fix bugs in open source
software.

The volunteer bug-fixing group that mainly includes students from
Lanzhou University, where I did my undergraduate studies, and UC
Riverside.

I will be at NetDev as well. See you there :)


2. To answer Laurent's question: All bug reports are human-reviewed.
For the past four months, we have been including a human-written and
reviewed patch when reporting bugs, with LLMs used only as an
assistive tool. However, because the volume is large and there are
some bugs we do not know how to fix well, we would like to make some
bug reports public in the interest of transparency.


3. To Hillf's point: if we start sending reports, the initial volume
will stay well below that level.


4. Regarding Andrew's point: Early on, we used syzbot config for
scanning and validation, and that did lead us to spend time on code
paths and features that may not matter much in practice. We should
definitely prioritize fixing bugs in actively maintained code.


5. And to Greg's point:

Yes, getting bugs fixed is the most important thing. The reason we
considered a syzbot-like workflow is that there are some validated
bugs which we currently do not know how to fix well ourselves. For
those cases we thought the community might have simpler ideas once the
report is made reproducible and concrete.

But we agree that any process around this should help move fixes
forward, not create another layer of overhead.

We have also received some bug bounty rewards from Google, which gives
us some resources to put back into this effort.
We are prepared to invest more engineering time in fixing these bugs,
and we are also considering hiring engineers to help.

Will you also be attending NetDev in person? If so, perhaps we can chat the=
