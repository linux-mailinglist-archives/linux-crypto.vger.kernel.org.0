I would really appreciate, if someone helps us to understand here. Maybe th=
ere is a
correct way to address this, but we just don't see it. The question is not =
even about
this particular crypto driver and the fact whenever it gests merged or not,=
 but the
logic of the crypto API subsystem.=20

As far as I understand the implementations that are provided by the special=
ized drivers
(like our Keem Bay OCS ECC driver example here) have a higher priority vs. =
generic
Implementations that exists in kernel, which makes sense because we expect =
these drivers
(and the security HW they talk to) to provide both more efficient and more =
secure
implementations than a pure SW implementation in kernel can do (even if it =
utilizes special
instructions, like SIMD, AESNI, etc.). However, naturally these drivers are=
 bound by=20
what security HW can do, and if it does not support a certain size/param of=
 the algorithm
(P-192 curve in our case), it is pointless and wrong for them to reimplemen=
t what SW is
already doing in kernel, so they should not do so and currently they re-dir=
ect to core kernel=20
implementation. So far good.=20

But now comes my biggest worry is that this redirection as far
as I can see is *internal to driver itself*, i.e. it does a callback to the=
se core functions from the driver
code, which again, unless I misunderstand smth, leads to the fact that the =
end user gets
P-192 curve ECC implementation from the core kernel that has been "promoted=
" to a highest
priority (given that ECC KeemBay driver for example got priority 300 to beg=
in with). So, if
we say we have another HW Driver 'Foo', which happens to implement P-192 cu=
rves more securely,
but happens to have a lower priority than ECC KeemBay driver, its implement=
ation would never
be chosen, but core kernel implementation will be used (via SW fallback int=
ernal to ECC Keem
Bay driver). =20

Another problem is that for a user of crypto API I don't see a way (and per=
haps I am wrong here)
to guarantee that all my calls to perform crypto operations will end up bei=
ng performed on a=20
security HW I want (maybe because this is the only thing I trust). It seems=
 to be possible in theory,
but in practice would require careful evaluation of a kernel setup and a sy=
nc between what=20
end user requests and what driver can provide. Let me try to explain a pote=
ntial scenario.=20
Lets say we had an end user that used to ask for both P-192 and P-384 curve=
-based ECC operations
and let's say we had a driver and security HW that implemented it. The end =
user made sure that
this driver implementation is always preferred vs. other existing implement=
ations. Now, time moves, a new=20
security HW comes instead that only supports P-384, and the driver now has =
been updated to
support P-192 via the SW fallback (like we are asked now).=20
Now, how does an end user notice that when it asks for a P-192 based operat=
ions, his operations
are not done in security HW anymore? The only way seems to be
is to know that driver and security HW has been updated, algorithms and siz=
es changed, etc.=20
It might take a while before the end user realizes this and for example sto=
ps using P-192 altogether,
but what if this silent redirect by the driver actually breaks some securit=
y assumptions (side-channel
resistance being one potential example) made by this end user? The conseque=
nces can be very bad.=20
You might say: "this is the end user problem to verify this", but shouldn't=
 we do smth to prevent or
at least indicate such potential issues to them?

Best Regards,
Elena.
