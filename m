I assume you mean the third patch you recently posted, "crypto: pcrypt - Avoid
deadlock by using per-instance padata queues".  That's true, the problem is
fixed there, and the bug being present in bisection doesn't seem like enough
justification to implement something short-lived just to prevent it.

Makes sense to me, though I don't see how it's enforced now in pcrypt.  I'm not
an async crypto person, but wouldn't unloading the pcrypt module when there are
still outstanding async jobs break this rule?

Actually, I'm working on an RFC right now to add more users for padata.  It
should be posted in the coming week or two, and I hope it can be part of that
discussion.
