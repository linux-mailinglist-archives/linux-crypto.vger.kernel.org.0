That assumes that it's possible to keep up with the device dirty rate.
It seems like a better approach for userspace would be to look at how
dirty_bytes is trending.  A zero value and a steady state value are
equivalent, there's nothing more to be gained by further iterations.  If
the value is trending down, it might be worthwhile to iterate in
PRE_COPY a while longer.  If the value is trending up, it might be time
to cut to STOP_COPY or abort the migration.

If we exclude STOP_COPY trailing data from the VFIO_DEVICE_MIG_PRECOPY
ioctl, it seems even more of a disconnect that when we enter the
STOP_COPY state, suddenly we start getting new data out of a PRECOPY
ioctl.

BTW, "VFIO_DEVICE" should be reserved for ioctls and data structures
relative to the device FD, appending it with _MIG is too subtle for me.
This is also a GET operation for INFO, so I'd think for consistency
with the existing vfio uAPI we'd name this something like
VFIO_MIG_GET_PRECOPY_INFO where the structure might be named
vfio_precopy_info.

So if we don't think this is the right approach for STOP_COPY, then why
are we pushing that it has any purpose outside of PRECOPY or might be
implemented by a non-PRECOPY driver for use in STOP_COPY?

For the reasons above, I just can't figure out why wouldn't decide that
use of this outside of PRECOPY is too quirky to bother with.  Thanks,
