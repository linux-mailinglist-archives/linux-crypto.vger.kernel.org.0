I now see the latest version does have them.  However, the description of this
patch explicitly states it was taken from CRYPTOGAMS commit
33fe84bc21219a16825459b37c825bf4580a0a7b.  Which is of course the one I looked
at, and it did not have them.  So the patch description is wrong.

There appears to be no kernel-mode support for Zicfilp yet.  This would be the
very first occurrence of the lpad instruction in the kernel source.

Keeping this anyway is fine if it's in the upstream version.  It just appeared
to be an undocumented change from the upstream version...

With this, we get:

- More complex code.
- Slower on CPUs that do support efficient misaligned accesses.
- The buffer underflows and overflows could cause problems with future CPU
  behavior.  (Did you consider the palette memory extension, for example?)

That being said, if there will continue to be many RISC-V CPUs that don't
support efficient misaligned accesses, then we effectively need to do this
anyway.  I hoped that things might be developing along the lines of ARM, where
eventually misaligned accesses started being supported uniformly.  But perhaps
RISC-V is still in the process of learning that lesson.

If I remember correctly, SiFive tested it on their hardware.
