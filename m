I understand your point; however, I believe that allowing the AF_ALG developer 
to use a generic data blob (of the appropriate size, of course) as a key is more 
versatile and allows for easier implementation of future extensions.

I think this might be acceptable if we consider the security we gain compared to 
using any existing user-space implementation!

Furthermore, I think one solution isn't mutually exclusive. So, why not give the 
developer the freedom to choose which interface to use? ;)

Furthermore, there's nothing stopping us from strengthening the current AF_ALG 
support so that it can also be used well with asymmetric keys.
