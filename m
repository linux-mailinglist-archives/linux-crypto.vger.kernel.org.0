the systems I was testing, I didn't saturate memory bandwidth until about t=
he full number of physical cores. From number of cores up to number of thre=
ads, the performance stayed about flat; it didn't get any better or worse.

That doesn't sound right though based on the numbers you provided. The
system you had was 192GB spread over 2 nodes with 48thread/24core per
node, correct? Your numbers went from ~290ms to ~28ms so a 10x
decrease, that doesn't sound linear when you spread the work over 24
cores to get there. I agree that the numbers largely stay flat once
you hit the peak, I have seen similar behavior when I was working on
the deferred init code previously. One concern I have though is that
we may end up seeing better performance with a subset of cores instead
of running all of the cores/threads, especially if features such as
turbo come into play. In addition we are talking x86 only so far. I
would be interested in seeing if this has benefits or not for other
architectures.

Also what is the penalty that is being paid in order to break up the
work before-hand and set it up for the parallel work? I would be
interested in seeing what the cost is on a system with fewer cores per
node, maybe even down to 1. That would tell us how much additional
overhead is being added to set things up to run in parallel. If I get
a chance tomorrow I might try applying the patches and doing some
testing myself.

Thanks.
