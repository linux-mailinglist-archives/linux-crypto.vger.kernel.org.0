Shouldn't you know ahead of time which algorithm you are using (or set of
algorithms which you might use), and not be parsing /proc/crypto and choosing
some random one (which might be a non-cryptographic algorithm like CRC-32, or
something known to be insecure like MD5)?

Using the algorithm attributes in /proc/crypto only really makes sense if the
decision of which algorithm to use is punted to a higher level and the program
just needs to be able to pass through *any* algorithm available in Linux -- like
how 'cryptsetup' works.  But it's preferable to avoid that sort of design, as it
invites users to start depending on weird or insecure things.

BLAKE2 does need a key if it is being used as a keyed hash algorithm.  So it
depends on the user, not the algorithm per se.
