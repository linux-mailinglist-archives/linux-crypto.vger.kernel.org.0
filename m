This all reminds me of some code I wrote a long time ago (1984?)
that worked out the maximum stack use for a system by processing
all the .o files to find out which functions called which at what
stack depth and adding everything up.
That system had no indirect calls and no recursion, but the worst
stack use was always in diagnostic prints in obscure error paths.

My guess is that the same is true for the Linux kernel.
While getting rid of large on-stack buffers fixes the obvious cases
full analysis is needed to guarantee the stack won't overflow.
Doing that requires some method for determining the stack use
of indirect calls - which really requires knowing which type of
function is actually being called from each place.
