I would argue that these cases are diametrically opposite: you
proposed to remove support for zero length input vectors from the
entire crypto API to prevent your driver from having to deal with
inputs that the hardware cannot handle.

I am proposing not to add support for cases that we have no need for.
XTS without CTS is indistinguishable from XTS with CTS if the inputs
are always a multiple of the block size, and in 12 years, nobody has
ever raised the issue that our support is limited to that. So what
problem are we fixing by changing this? dm-crypt does not care,
fscrypt does not care, userland does not care (given that it does not
work today and we are only finding out now due to some fuzz test
failing on CAAM)

Of course. But why add this at all if it is known to be dead code?
