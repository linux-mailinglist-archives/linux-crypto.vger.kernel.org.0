That's a good point, I'll change the alignment.

I kicked off some runs on the Skylake bare metal system to check how this did
and the performance stayed the same, but see below.

I think you may be assuming that threads work in MAX_ORDER batches, maybe
because that's the job's min_chunk, but padata works differently.  The
min_chunk is a lower bound that establishes the smallest amount of work that
makes sense for a thread to do in one go, so in this case it's useful to
prevent starting large numbers of threads to initialize a tiny amount of pages.

Internally padata uses total job size and min chunk to arrive at the chunk
size, which on big machines will be much larger than min_chunk.  The idea is
the chunk size should be large enough to minimize multithreading overhead but
small enough to permit load balancing between threads.

This is probably why the results didn't change much when aligning by section,
but that doesn't mean other systems won't benefit.

I should have been explicit, was thinking of @i from
for_each_free_mem_pfn_range_in_zone_from() when mentioning the opaque index.

How are you thinking of combining them?  I don't see a way to do it without
storing an arbitrary number of ranges somewhere for each thread.

Yes, that was clever, we should keep doing it that way.
