The authentication tag is part of the ciphertext, not the plaintext.  So the
rule is just that the ciphertext buffer needs to have room for it, not the
plaintext.

Of course, when doing in-place encryption/decryption, the two buffers are the
same, so both will have room for it, even though the tag is only meaningful on
the ciphertext side.  That's just the logical consequence of "in-place".

Requiring users to remember to provide a flag to indicate in-place
encryption/decryption, in addition to passing the same scatterlist, would make
the API more complex.

If we consider that the input is not just a scatterlist, but rather a
scatterlist and a length, then these observations are really just "you can
access the first byte, unless the length is 0" -- which is sort of obvious.  And
requiring a dereferencable pointer for length = 0 is generally considered to be
bad API design; see the memcpy() fiasco
(https://www.imperialviolet.org/2016/06/26/nonnull.html).

The API could be simplified by only supporting full scatterlists, but it seems
that users are currently relying on being able to encrypt/decrypt just a prefix.

IMO, the biggest problems with the AEAD API are actually things you didn't
mention, such as the fact that the AAD isn't given in a separate scatterlist,
and that the API only supports scatterlists and not virtual addresses (which
makes it difficult to use in some cases).

In any case we do need much better documentation.  I'm planning to improve some
of the crypto API documentation, but I'll probably do the hash and skcipher
algorithm types first before getting to AEAD.  So if you want to improve the
AEAD documentation in the mean time, please go ahead.
