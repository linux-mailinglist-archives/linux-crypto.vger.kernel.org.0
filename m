No, this is incorrect. If you allocate a fallback algorithm in the
correct way, the crypto API will resolve the allocation in the usual
manner, and select whichever of the remaining implementations has the
highest priority (provided that it does not require a fallback
itself).

I don't think it is possible at the API level to define rules that
will always produce the most secure combination of drivers. The
priority fields are only used to convey relative performance (which is
already semantically murky, given the lack of distinction between
hardware with a single queue vs software algorithms that can be
executed by all CPUs in parallel).

When it comes to comparative security, trustworthiness or robustness
of implementations, it is simply left up to the user to blacklist
modules that they prefer not to use. When fallback allocations are
made in the correct way, the remaining available implementations will
be used in priority order.
