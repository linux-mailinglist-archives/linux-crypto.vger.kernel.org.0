It's not appropriate to add UAPIs with no regards for increasing the kernel's
attack surface, especially for things that can easily be done in userspace.  The
kernel community is already struggling with thousands of syzbot reports and
constant security vulnerabilites.  I understand that your patch is not yet
finished, but it doesn't really matter; this is no need for this patch at all as
you can just convert PEM => DER in userspace.

PEM decoding is just some data processing which can be implemented in userspace
in any programming language, so it's not fundamentally different from
sys_leftpad().  So in my opinion the comparison is relevant.
