Regardless of all of that, the Linux implementation does in fact use
separate keys for tweak and data. That is why the key sizes are double
wrt ordinary AES, i.e., 32 bytes for XTS-AES-128 and 64 bytes for
XTS-AES-256.

Again, agreed, which also happens to be the reason why I am arguing
that the bare cipher API should not be exposed outside of the crypto
subsystem at all.

I am not disagreeing with that at all. This is actually one of the
main reasons for my work on refactoring the way AES is being used in
the kernel: for historical reasons, many drivers have a hard
dependency on CONFIG_CRYPTO_AES, and pull in the aes-generic driver,
and so at the moment, it is not possible to disable it. Going forward,
I'd like to refine this further so that aes-generic can be replaced by
aes-ti.

See above. In the future, I'd like to ensure that aes-generic does not
have to be built into the core kernel (which will be possible once
existing core kernel users that require AES switch to the AES library
or stop using AES altogether). That way, the module can be blacklisted
or omitted from the kernel build altogether (as well as other modules
that reimplement that same algorithm using arch specific assembly
code)
