I never said power consumption is *always* more important. You were
assuming it never is.

Of course.

True. But we have already painted ourselves into a corner here, since
whatever we expose to userland today cannot simply be revoked.

I guess you could argue that your particular driver should not be
exposed to userland, and I think we may even have a CRYPTO_ALG_xxx
flag for that. But even if that does happen, it doesn't mean you can
stop caring about zero length inputs :-)
