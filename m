Just to add a few more details here:

This means that we can have userspace drivers and the kernel driver 
simultaneously accessing these mailboxes.

The strange thing (to me) about this hw is that we cannot interleave 
mailbox accesses on different functions - with 2x 64b accesses, for 
example. This is the reason that we require 128b accesses.

The upshot is that we can't switch to generic code unfortunately.

But I am not sure if the change is right, as I mentioned originally, 
above ***.

I'll leave to Arnd's better judgment :)
