I have been staring at net/xfrm/xfrm_algo.c, and as far as I can tell,
algorithms have to be mentioned there in order to be usable. None of
the ciphers that this patch touches are listed there or anywhere else
in the kernel.

That is a good point, actually, since dm-crypt could be affected here
as well, hence the CCs.

Milan (or others): are you aware of any of these ciphers being used
for dm-crypt?

OK, thanks for confirming. Removing those would be a good start.
