No. It's not repeatable *at all*. The odds of getting the exact same sequen=

numbers should approach zero, assuming that random generator is half decent=
 and=20
properly seeded with another (true?) random value.=20

For us hardware engineers, (constrained) random testing is our bread and bu=
tter.
Given the design complexity we're dealing with today and the fact that any =
serious bug may=20
actually put us out of business (considering mask costs and respin turnarou=
nd), it's the only=20
way to cope. So I have many years of experience and I can assure you that b=
eing "not always
repeatable" does not NEED to be the "nature of fuzz testing".  As one of th=
e first things you=20
learn (the hard way) is to log the random seed(s) and make them controllabl=
e ... somehow.
Because nothing is as frustrating as finding a bug after days of simulation=
 and then
not being able to reproduce it with waves and debugging enabled ...

>=20
Yes, this is a well known fact: any change to either the design, the test e=
nvironment or
the test itself may affect the random generation and cause different behavi=
or.
Which may be a problem if you want to hit a specific case with 100% certain=
ty - in
which case you should indeed make a dedicated test for that instead.
(but usually, you don't realise the corner case exists until you first hit =
it ...)

*However* this is NOT relevant to the repeatability-for-debugging situation=
, as in
that case, you should should not change *anything* until you've thoroughly =
root-
caused the issue. (or created a baseline in your source control system such=
 that you
can always go back to the *exact* situation  that caused the error).
This is (hardware) verification 101.

>=20
That may be because you've been working mostly with software implementation=
s
which were already in pretty good shape to begin with. Hardware tends to ha=
ve=20
many more (tricky) corner cases.
The odds of hitting a specific corner case in just 100 or 1000 vectors is r=
eally not
as high as you may think. Especially if many of the vectors being generated=
 are
actually illegal and just test for proper error response from the driver.

Just try to compute the (current) odds of getting an AAD length and cipher =
text
length that are zero at the same time. Which is a relevant corner case at l=
east for
our hardware. In fact, having the digestsize zero at the same time as well =
is yet=20
another corner case requiring yet another workaround. The odds of those 3=20
cases colliding while generating random lengths over a decent range are rea=
lly,
really slim.

Also, how fast you can reboot depends very much on the platform you're=20
working on. It quickly becomes annoying if rebooting takes minutes and plen=
ty
of manual interaction. Speaking from experience.

The problem with "generating a test vector for it" is that it requires a kn=
own-
good reference implementation, which is usually hard to find. And then you
have to convert it to testmgr.h format and add it there manually. Which is =
both
cumbersome and will cause testmgr.h (and kernel size) to explode at some po=
int.

While in the overal majority of cases you don't really care about the input=
 data
itself at all, so it's fine to generate that randomly, what you care about =
are things=20
like specific lengths, alignments, sizes, IV (counter) values and combinati=
ons thereof.

Also, adding those as "normal" test vectors will cause the normal boot prod=
ure to
slow to a crawl verifying  loads of obscure corner cases that are really on=
ly relevant
during development anyway.=20

And why bother if you have the generic implementation available to do all=20
this on-the-fly and only with the extra tests enabled, just like you do wit=
h the full=20
random vectors?

It was just a crazy idea anyway, based on a real-life observation I made.

Running just 10 times more iterations is really not going to be sufficient =
to hit
the really tricky *combinations* of parameters, considering the ranges of t=
he
individual parameters. Just do some statistics on that and you'll soon real=
ise.

Just some example for the AEAD corner case I mentioned before:

The odds of generating a zero authsize are 1/4 * 1/17 =3D 1/68. But that wi=
ll still
need to coincide with all other parameters (including key sizes) being lega=
l.
So there already, your 100 iterations come short.

A zero length AAD *and* plaintext happens only once every 8000+ vectors.
And that also still has to coincide with key sizes etc. being legal. So the=
re even
10000 iterations would not be enough to be *sure* to hit that.

To have some reasonable shot at hitting the combination those two cases
you'd need well over a million iterations ...

>=20
I guess somehow tweaking the random generation such that the probability of=
=20
generating the interesting cases becomes *significantly* higher would work =
too.
To me, that's just implementation detail though.
