I'm not asking you or anyone to fix this right away.  I'm just
saying that this is the direction we should be moving in.

After all, there is no immediate crisis as all that is broken
today is a fuzz test.

It should be possible to do this without causing performance
regressions for ARM.  We could rename the existing xts to a
new name (xek perhaps) and add xts into the cts template as
a wrapper around xek.

That way you don't have to touch the ARM code at all and it
should just work.

PS should we mark xek or whatever it's called as internal so
it isn't visible to user-space?

Cheers,
