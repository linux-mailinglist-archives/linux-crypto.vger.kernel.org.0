PK: I think the mistake from my side was to create 'n' nodes with the
same base addresses and different Virtual IDs, and misinterpret your
earlier guidance on this. Instead every "virtual" SPAcc instance can
be represented with its own DT node, since its base address and IRQ
numbers are unique. The "virtual" refers to a hardware feature in the
SPAcc. Each virtual SPAcc, configured at hardware design-time, has its
own control registers, IRQ numbers and contexts, only the crypto
hardware is shared.
