Looking at it again a bit more closely, both fsverity and dm-verity have
per-block information that they need to keep track of in the queue in addition
to the data buffers and hashes: the block number, and in dm-verity's case also a
bvec_iter pointing to that block.

So I think it really does make sense to have them both handle the queueing
themselves, and not have it split between them and some crypto API helper
functions (i.e. two queues that mirror each other).

It would be possible, though, to organize the code in dm-verity and fsverity to
represent the queue as an array and operate on it as such.  That would also
address your concern about the two code paths.  Again, things would end up being
a bit less efficient than my more optimized code that handles 1x and 2x (which
is all that's actually needed for now) specifically, but it would work, I think.
