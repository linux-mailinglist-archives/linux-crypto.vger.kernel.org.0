Yes, that is annoying...  Maybe the acomp API should not support arbitrary
scatterlists, but rather only ones that can be mapped contiguously?

Either way, I think the way out may be that zcomp should support *both* the
scomp and acomp APIs.  It should use scomp by default, and if someone *really*
wants to use a hardware (de)compression accelerator, they can configure it to
use acomp.

Also, I see that crypto/scompress.c currently allocates scratch buffers (256KB
per CPU!) whenever any crypto_scomp tfm is initialized.  That seems wrong.  It
should only happen when a crypto_acomp tfm that is backed by a crypto_scomp tfm
is initialized.  Then, if acomp is not used, all this craziness will be avoided.
