I wasn't really arguing about the tag, but rather that this
implementation is not in the direction that we suggested.

FWIW, the way I usually handle "Suggested-by" is if the core idea of a
patch was suggested by someone. In this case, these are normal review
comments that you addressed, so I wouldn't add the tag. The only case
in which I add the tag in response to review comments is if they
resulted in a new patch that was the reviewer's idea.

Just my 2c, perhaps others do it differently.

While I do appreciate your eagerness, I will be completely honest
here. The change to batch reclaim of unrelated folios, while can be
reasonable, is an order of magnitude more controversial imo. By
tightly coupling this to this series, you are doing yourself a
disservice tbh. I would say drop any changes specific to that for now.
Leave that to a completely separate discussion. This is the easiest
way to make forward progress on this series, which I am sure is what
we all want here (and I do very much appreciate your work!).

I wouldn't send intermediate versions that are not the code you want
to be merged. It's not the best use of anyone's time to send code that
both of us agree is not what we want to merge anyway. Even if that
means a rewrite between versions, that's not uncommon as long as you
describe the changes in the changelog.

Yeah I would drop this for now as I mentioned earlier.

If this is a pure optimization that is not needed initially, I would
do it in a separate patch after this one. Even better if it's a follow
up patch, this is already dense enough :)

To summarize, I understand your eagerness to present all the work you
have in mind, and I appreciate it. But it's most effective to have
changes in independent digestible chunks wherever possible. For next
versions, I would only include the bare minimum to support the
compression batching and showcase its performance benefits. Extensions
and optimizations can be added on top once this lands. This makes both
your life and the reviewers' lives a lot easier, and ultimately gets
things merged faster.
