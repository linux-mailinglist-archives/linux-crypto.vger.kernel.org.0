No, the problem I'm talking about is different and is new to your patch.  If
tmpl(X-accelerated) is registered while someone is doing crypto_alg_mod_lookup()
that triggered instantiation of tmpl(X-generic), then crypto_alg_mod_lookup()
could fail with ENOENT, instead of returning tmpl(X-generic) as it does
currently.  This is because the proposed new logic will not fulfill the request
larval if a better implementation of tmpl(X) is still being tested.  But there's
no guarantee that tmpl(X) will finish being tested by the time cryptomgr_probe()
thinks it is done and complete()s the request larval with 'adult' still NULL.

(I think; I haven't actually tested this, this analysis is just based on my
reading of the code...)
