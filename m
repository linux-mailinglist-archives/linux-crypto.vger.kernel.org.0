It certainly can, at least on arm64 where coherent buffers are remapped 
in vmalloc rather than changing the linear map attributes in-place. In 
that case the dma_alloc_coherent() flow looks like this:

1: clean and invalidate pages by (cacheable) linear map address
2: set up non-cacheable remap
3: write zeros via non-cacheable mapping
...
4: CPU writes descriptor via non-cacheable mapping
...
5: device reads descriptor

If the cacheable alias is prefetched back in between steps 1 and 4 (e.g. 
from another thread accessing an adjacent page by linear map address), 
the CPU writes will (usually) still bypass the caches and go straight to 
DRAM, so if the device read unexpectedly snoops it can return the older 
data from the cache. This will normally be the zeros from step 3, unless 
you're extremely unlucky and the prefetch happened even before that. As 
I mentioned, this is exactly what we were hitting with Panfrost where 
GPU coherency wasn't described.
