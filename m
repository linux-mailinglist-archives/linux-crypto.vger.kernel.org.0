That *must* not be the recommendation of the kernel crypto team. Why 
bother developing and deploying a kernel that boots in fips mode at all 
if you recommend users not use it? More below.

While the FIPS module is "the whole kernel", re-validation for most 
types of kernel upgrades may not prompt a full submission for FIPS 
certification. A CVE re-validation can be as simple as re-filing a 
description of the change to the module or worst case, a re-test of any 
crypto functions that were changed to support the CVE fix. The most 
expensive re-validation (other than a full submission) is the UPDT 
re-validation submission. In either case, the overhead of the 
re-validation is mostly with the CSTL, not with the government. The 
lion's share of the time for a FIPS 140-3 FS (full submission) 
certificate comes *after* the CSTL submits the validation to NIST.

And to be clear, the FedRAMP requirement is that FIPS certifications or 
re-validation be *filed* (not awarded) within 6 months of release of the 
crypto module ("the whole kernel"). The caveat here is that you have to 
have a certificate to file for a re-validation submission. Given NIST 
backlog, it doesn't seem likely that you'll avoid a full submission if 
you don't already have a 140-3 certificate.

IMO, this is an optimal solution for a specialized distro; 
general-purpose OS's *should* update and use the actively developed 
crypto api.

BTW, I agree with you that fewer Linux kernel users need to certify at all.

Please see FedRAMP's differentiation between update stream and 
validation module stream.
