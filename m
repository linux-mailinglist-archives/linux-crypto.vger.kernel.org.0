The split test cases expect the same output (same sequence of bytes) as the
non-split test cases.  The only difference is how the data is split up into
scatterlist elements.  Yes, that means that a single 16-byte block of the
keystream may need to be XOR'ed with data from multiple scatterlist elements.
Take a look at how other drivers handle this.
