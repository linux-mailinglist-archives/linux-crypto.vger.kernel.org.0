I would agree that ansi_csprng could be eliminated at this stage. However, =
the=20
S390 DRBG code base provides access to the CPACF DRBG implemented in the IB=
M Z=20
processors. That implementation must be seeded from software. See the funct=
ion=20
invocation of cpacf_klmd or cpacf_kmc in the prng.c file.

The extraction of the entropy source and DRNG management into its own=20
component separates out the security sensitive implementation currently fou=
nd=20
in multiple locations following the strategy found in the crypto API where=
=20
each moving part is separated and encapsulated.

The current implementation of the ESDM allows an easy addition of new entro=
py=20
sources which are properly encapsulated in self-contained code allowing sel=
f-
contained entropy analyses to be performed for each. These entropy sources=
=20
would provide their seed data completely separate from other entropy source=
s=20
to the DRNG preventing any mutual entanglement and thus challenges in the=20
entropy assessment. I have additional entropy sources already available tha=
t I=20
would like to contribute at a later stage. These entropy sources can be=20
enabled, disabled or its entropy rate set as needed by vendors depending on=
=20
their entropy source analysis. Proper default values would be used for the=
=20
common case where a vendor does not want to perform its own analysis or a=20
distro which want to provide a common kernel binary for many users.

The conditioning hash that is available to the entropy sources is currently=
=20
fixed to a SHA-256 software implementation. To support conveying more entro=
py=20
through the conditioning hash, I would like to contribute an extension that=
=20
allows the use of the kernel crypto API's set of message digest=20
implementations to be used. This would not only allow using larger message=
=20
digests, but also hashes other than SHA.

Depending on use cases, it is possible that different initial seeding=20
strategies are required to be considered for the DRNG. The initial patch se=
t=20
provides the oversampling of entropy sources and of the initial seed string=
 in=20
addition to the conventional approach of providing at least as much entropy=
 as=20
the security strength of the DRNG. There is a different seeding strategy in=
=20
the pipeline that is considered by other cryptographers for which I would l=
ike=20
to contribute the respective patch.

NUMA-awareness is another aspect that should be considered. The DRNG manage=
r=20
is prepared to instantiate one DRNG per node. The respective handler code,=
=20
however, is not part of the initial code drop.

In addition to the different DRNG implementations discussed before, there i=
s=20
the possibility to add an implementation to support atomic operations. The=
=20
current DRBG does not guarantee to be suitable for such use cases.

Ciao
Stephan
