Jason,
if the current code is mistakenly stretching the entropy, perhaps the
correct curse of action is to correct that mistake first, before
introducing a new conditioning function.
As it is, these patches cannot be say to just perform conditioning if
they are stretching the entropy, the risk is compounding errors and
voiding any reasonable analysis of the entropy carried through the RNG.

It would also be nice to have an explanation (in the patch or at least
the commit message) about how entropy is preserved and why a specific
function is cryptographically adequate. Note that there is no study
about using internal states of hash functions, it would be better to
base these decisions on solid ground by citing relevant research or
standards.

Thanks,
Simo.
