Is there no way for the kernel to invalidate the memory and tell the
process to stop?  tty drivers do this for when they are removed from the
system.

Anyway, this is all very rare, no kernel module is ever unloaded on a
real system, that is only for when developers are working on them, so
it's probably not that big of an issue, right?
