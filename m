I think the ISO C standard should not support any syntax that allows
optimizations without diagnostics.  Those are huge footguns.

We already have experience in GCC with __attribute__((__nonnull__())).
A better would look like 'const', and should diagnose any violations at
compile time.

Then, ISO C added 'restrict', which is another case of optimizations
without diagnostics.  See also:
<https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=3D112833>.

And [static n] is essentially the same kind of bad stuff.  In fact, it
implies __attribute__((__nonnull__())), so that should tell enough.

At least, the GCC attribute is not part of the type system.  It's bad,
but it doesn't claim to be good.  But having [static n] as if it were
part of the type system, but then using it for optimizations, that's
just evil.

Okay.

Ahhh, sanitizers.  Yeah, sanitizers are usually bad for diagnostics.

GCC gives more diagnostics for [static n] than Clang.

Clang is even worse at [n] than at [static n], but it's bad at both.

Thanks for researching this!  That would be very useful!  Please CC me
if you write any patches about this; I'm interested.


Have a lovely night!
