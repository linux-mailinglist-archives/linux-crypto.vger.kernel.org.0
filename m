I agree with your assessment. Not only when looking at cipher or template 
implementations, but also when looking at the scatterwalk API the SGL length 
field is processed first. If the length field is insufficient then the SGL is 
not processed.

The statement here (and maybe it could be updated) refers to a valid SGL with 
a size > 0, but where the first SGL entry points to a NULL buffer. This is an 
invalid use of an SGL.

Specifically for AEAD, the SGL must have the form of (assoc data || 
plaintext). As the AAD is not required for a successful cipher operation, the 
caller of the crypto API must guarantee the AAD is either non-NULL or the SGL 
must start with the plaintext as the first entry.
