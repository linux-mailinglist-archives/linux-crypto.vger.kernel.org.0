Hi Jason,

Thank you for the timely respond and your patient. And sorry for the 
confusion.

First of all, what we think is that this change (removing O_NONBLOCK) is 
reasonable. However, this do cause issue during the test on one of our 
product which uses O_NONBLOCK flag the way I presented earlier in the 
Linux 4.4 era. Thus our colleague suggests that returning -EINVAL when 
this flag is received would be a good way to indicate this change.

For example:


-- 
Best
GUO Zihua

-- 
Best
GUO Zihua
