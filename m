I got your point, and I still think it's a bad one, for the reasons
already explained to you. If it's a hardware RNG, then it's sensible to
assume it provides hardware random bits, unless we have documentation
that says it provides something less than perfect.

Now you've moved on to talking again about entropy estimation. Stop with
this nonsense. Entropy estimation is an impossible proposition that
actually results in an infoleak. With that said, a self-test to make
sure the hardware isn't completely borked would be a nice thing, but
this applies for any device no matter what assumptions are made. So if
you want to work on that, go ahead, but it's completely orthogonal to
this change here.
