This is called once per XTS request, right? And you are saying the
extra cycle makes a difference?

CONFIG_HAVE_EFFICIENT_UNALIGNED_ACCESS means 'just use the unaligned
accessors as they are basically free'. Casting a potentially
misaligned u8* to a u64* is not permitted by the C standard.

No, please just use the get_unaligned() accessor.
