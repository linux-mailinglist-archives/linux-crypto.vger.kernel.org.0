I'd like for Adiantum to continue to be accelerated on x86, but it doesn't have
to squeeze out all performance possible on x86, given that hardware AES support
is available there so most people will use that instead.  So if e.g. the ChaCha
implementation is still AVX2 accelerated, but it's primarily optimized for
networking packets rather than disk encryption, that would probably be fine.
