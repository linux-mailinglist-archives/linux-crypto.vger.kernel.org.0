I think you have your answer right there - by _not_ making the API
generic and giving no motivation to use it, different vendors are
going to do different things (maybe even with a different API as well)
so there's no point the kernel driver pretending to be a generic
driver. If the driver isn't going to be generic, I see little point in
the SMC function number being in DT.

I think that as a _whole_ is a big mistake - there should be a generic
kernel driver for this, and there should be a standardised interface to
it through firmware.  So, I would encourage you to try to get it
accepted one way or another amongst vendors as a standardised
interface.
