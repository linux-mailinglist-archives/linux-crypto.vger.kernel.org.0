Above it states very clearly: "and use it in x509_cert_parse() and
x509_key_preparse()".

That's the reason it is not a one-liner patch.

I disagree.  It is important as a justification for the change that
the two functions converted here are not going to be the only users,
but that there's a third one coming up.

Okay, I will respin and change to passive mood.

That doesn't sound like constructive criticism.

The reason for the commit is that Jonathan requested it during code
review of my PCI device authentication patches.  I've been stating
this very clearly in the first iteration of the present patch.
You asked that I delete the sentence and instead use a Suggested-by.

Perhaps it would have been better had I not listened to you.
Because now you seem to have forgotten the reason for the patch,
which, again, you asked me to delete.

FWIW, here's the link to Jonathan's review:
https://lore.kernel.org/all/20231003153937.000034ca@Huawei.com/

And here's the quote with his explicit request to use cleanup.h:

   "Maybe cleanup.h magic?  Seems like it would simplify error paths here a
    tiny bit. Various other cases follow, but I won't mention this every time
    [...]
    Even this could be done with the cleanup.h stuff with appropriate
    pointer stealing and hence allow direct returns.
    This is the sort of case that I think really justifies that stuff."

Thanks,

Lukas
