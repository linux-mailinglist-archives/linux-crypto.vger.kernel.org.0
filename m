According to https://github.com/riscv/riscv-profiles/blob/main/profiles.adoc,
Zicclsm means that "main memory supports misaligned loads/stores", but they
"might execute extremely slowly."

In general, the vector crypto routines that Jerry is adding assume that
misaligned vector loads/stores are supported *and* are fast.  I think the kernel
mustn't register those algorithms if that isn't the case.  Zicclsm sounds like
the wrong thing to check.  Maybe RISCV_HWPROBE_MISALIGNED_FAST is the right
thing to check?

BTW, something else I was wondering about is endianness.  Most of the vector
crypto routines also assume little endian byte order, but I don't see that being
explicitly checked for anywhere.  Should it be?
