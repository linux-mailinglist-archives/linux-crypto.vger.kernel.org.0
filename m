No that's not the main reason.  The main user of chaining is
algif_skcipher.

I was merely suggesting that requests to CTS/XTS shouldn't be
split up.  Doing it for others would be a serious regression.

However, having looked at this it would seem that the effort
in marking CTS/XTS is not that different to just adding support
to hold the last two blocks of data so that CTS/XTS can support
chaining.

I'll work on this.
