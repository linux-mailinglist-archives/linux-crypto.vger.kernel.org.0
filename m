CONFIG_DM_CRYPT can either select every weird combination of algorithms anyone
can ever be using, or it can select some defaults and require any other needed
algorithms to be explicitly selected.

In reality, dm-crypt has never even selected any particular block ciphers, even
AES.  Nor has it ever selected XTS.  So it's actually always made users (or
kernel distributors) explicitly select algorithms.  Why the Bitlocker support
suddenly different?

I'd think a lot of dm-crypt users don't want to bloat their kernels with random
legacy algorithms.
