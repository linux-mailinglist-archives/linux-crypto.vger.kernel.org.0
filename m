Thank you for clarifying that. It sounds to me that there is no defined
protocol (or if there, I would be wondering how the code would have worked
with a different implementation). Would it make sense to first specify a
protocol for authentication and have it discussed? I personally think it is a
bit difficult to fully understand the protocol from the code and discuss
protocol-level items based on the code.

Thanks
Stephan
