I'm the Manager in charge of auditing and accounting unit foreign
remittance department of UNITED BANK FOR AFRICA (U.B.A) Ouaga-Burkina
Faso in West
Africa, with due respect and regards, I have decided to contact you on a
business transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end
of the transaction.

During my investigation and auditing in the bank in my department I came
across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person, a foreigner
who died in a plane crash and the fund has been dormant in his account with
the bank without any claim of the fund in our custody either from his
family or relation before our discovery to this development.
Although personally, I kept this information secret within myself to enable
the whole plans and idea be profitable and successful during the time of
execution, The amount involved is USD $5.3,000,000. (Five million
three hundred us
dollars.) Meaning the whole arrangement and directives needed to put claim
over this fund as the benefit next of kin to the deceased, will be forward
to you upon your acceptance information will be relayed to you as soon as
you indicate your interest and willingness to assist me and also benefit
yourself to this great business opportunity.

In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in
this country as a civil servant, we are not allowed to operate a foreign
account and would eventually raise an eyebrow on my side during the time
of transfer because I work in this bank. This is the current reason why it
will require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next
of kin with affidavit of trust of Oath to the bank and also present a
foreign account where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on
his request for it as it may be, after due verification and clarification to
designated bank account.

I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free, On
smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 40% of the
total sum as gratification, while 50% 10% for any incurable expenses
that will come during the transfer, you have been advised to keep top
secret as we are still in service and intend to remove from service after
we conclude this deal with you.

I will be monitoring the whole situation here in the bank until you confirm
the money in your account and ask us to come down to your country for
subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously
indicated further investment, either in your country or any other
country you may advise us to invest in.

All other necessary information will be sent to you when I hear from you
i suggest you get back to me as soon as possible stating your wish in this
deal..Reply me through my private E-mail address:
mohamedouedraogo1987@gmail.com


Best Regard
From Mr. Mohamed Ouedraogo
