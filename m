Hi Adhemerval,

Thanks for your review.

I think Eric already pointed those out, and they're fixed in v3 now.
PTAL.

I don't know glibc's requirements for kernels, though I do know that
it'd be nice to not have to write this fallback code in every program I
write and just use libc's thing. So in that sense, having the fallback
to /dev/urandom makes arc4random_buf a lot more useful. But with that
said, yea, maybe we shouldn't care about old kernels? getrandom is now
quite old and the stable kernels on kernel.org all have it.

From my perspective, I don't have a strongly developed opinion on what
makes sense for glibc. If Florian agrees with you, I'll send a v+1 with
the fallback code removed. If it's contentious, maybe the fallback code
should stay in and we can slate it for removal on another day, when the
minimum glibc kernel version gets raised or something like that.

I was aware of the race but figured it didn't matter, since two racing
threads will both set it to the same result eventually. But I didn't
know about the convention of using those relaxed wrapper functions.
Thanks for the tip. I'll do that for v4.

I guess only if syscall filtering is a concern. But if not, then maybe
yea? We could do this in a follow-up commit, or I could do this in v4.
Would `#if __LINUX_KERNEL_VERSION >` be the right mechanism to use here?
If so, I think the way I'd implement that would be:

diff --git a/stdlib/arc4random.c b/stdlib/arc4random.c

     }

And then arc4random_getrandom_failure() being a noreturn function would
make gcc optimize out the rest.

Does that seem like a good approach?

No, generally not. Also, keep in mind that getrandom(0) will trigger
jitter entropy if the kernel isn't already initialized.

Generally it's frowned upon to have implicit signed conversion, right? l
is signed while n is unsigned.

I was really confused by this, and then opened up some other files and
saw you meant *after* period. :) Will do for v4.

Oh that sounds like a good solution to the time64 situation. I'll do
that for v4... BUT, I already implemented possibly the wrong solution
for v3. Could you take a look at what I did there and confirm that it's
wrong? If so, then I'll do exactly what you suggested here.

Thanks again for the review,
Jason
