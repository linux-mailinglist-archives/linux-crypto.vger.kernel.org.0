Ok.

NULL is not an array of zero elements.  NULL is an invalid pointer,
often used as a sentinel value.

Consider for example the freezero(3) function from OpenBSDs libc.  If
we could use arrays of void, we could define it as

	void
	freezero(size_t n;
	    void p[n], size_t n)
	{
		if (p !=3D NULL)
			explicit_bzero(p, n);
		free(p);
	}

Where p is either a null pointer, or a pointer to an object with at
least n bytes.

Often, APIs will want nonnull pointers, but this isn't special of [n].
APIs taking null pointers are rare per-se.

Indeed, be careful about the latter.  In this specific case, it may be
not the case, but you should be aware of this issue in case you consider
using [static n] more often.  This could be a footgun.

There are other ways to get the same diagnostic without the dangers of
[static n].

This is not true.

-  [n] is advisory in standard C, but in GCC, it can be mandatory,
   as long as you use proper compiler flags.

-  [static n] is unnecessary, and --except for the dangers mentioned
   above--, is entirely ignored by many compilers, including GCC.

GCC already enforces [n].  See above.  I'm using:

	alx@devuan:~/tmp$ gcc --version

	Copyright (C) 2025 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

Clang doesn't enforce it.  Clang doesn't even enforce [static n].
Clang is in fact quite bad at diagnosing array bounds violations.
Aaron, could you please fix this in Clang?

I'm working on convincing the C Committee regarding this at the moment.
In the meantime, we have GCC available.

Not so much.  GCC is here already.  And the C Committee could be
convinced.

> In the mean time, we don't need to delay using the tool we have now.

Are you sure [static n] is a tool?  I don't see any compiler diagnosing
it differently from [n].  Neither GCC nor Clang diagnose it, from what
I've shown above.

You could name the function as __xchacha20poly1305_dont_call_me_directly()
to make sure it's never called.

If you want to enforce a minimum array size, you could change the static
assertions to do >=3D instead.

You could also lift the check when the input is a pointer:

	static_assert(!is_array(nonce)
	              || sizeof(nonce) >=3D XCHACHA20POLY1305_NONCE_SIZE);

It all depends on what you need exactly.


Have a lovely day!
