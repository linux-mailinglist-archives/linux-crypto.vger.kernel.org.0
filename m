Yeah I can see how you could argue that. However, syzkaller is also
effectively the only fuzzer now that supports what you later call "smart
input generation", and adding it to any other fuzzer is really not
straight-forward, at least to me. No other fuzzer seems to really have
felt a need to have this, and there are ... dozens?

Right.

Yes, I understand, I guess it just feels a bit like a fig-leaf to me to
paper over "you need syzkaller" because there's no way to really
(efficiently) use it for fuzzing.

Oh, I get that you wouldn't necessarily want to have a dependency on
syzkaller in the kernel example code, but in a sense my argument is that
there's no such tool at all since syzkaller cannot output anything, and
then you need to write all the descriptions by hand. Which is fine for
an _example_ but really doesn't scale to actually running fuzzing.

So then we're mostly back to "you need syzkaller to run fuzzing against
this", which at least to me isn't a great situation.

Yeah I guess, but that still requires hand-coding the descriptions (or
writing a separate parser), and notably doesn't work with a sort of in-
process fuzzing I was envisioning for ARCH=3Dum. Which ought to be much
faster, and even combinable with fork() as I alluded to in earlier
emails.

I mean, yeah, I guess but ... Is there a fuzzer that is able generate
such input? I haven't seen one. And running the bridge tool separately
is going to be rather expensive (vs. in-process like I'm thinking
about), and some form of data extraction is needed to make this scale at
all.

Sure, I can do it all manually for a single test, but is it really a
good idea that syzkaller is the only thing that could possibly run this
at scale?

Well, I guess my thought is that there isn't actually going to be a good
example that really _requires_ all this flexibility. We're going to want
to test (mostly?) functions that consume untrusted data, but untrusted
data tends to come in the form of a linear blob, via the network, from a
file, from userspace, etc. Pretty much only the syscall boundary has
highly structured untrusted data, but syzkaller already fuzzes that and
we're not likely to write special kfuzztests for syscalls?

Well, you wouldn't need the whole custom serialization format and
deserialization code for a start, nor the linker changes around
KFUZZTEST_TABLE since run-time discovery would likely be sufficient,
though of course those are trivial. And the deserialization is almost
half of the overall infrastructure code?

Anyway, I don't really know what to do. Maybe this has even landed by
now ;-) I certainly would've preferred something that was easier to use
with other fuzzers and in-process fuzzing in ARCH=3Dum, but then that'd
now mean I need to plug it in at a completely different level, or write
a DWARF parser and serializer if I don't want to have to hand-code each
target.

I really do want to do fuzz testing on wifi, but with kfuzztest it
basically means I rely on syzbot to actually run it or have to run
syzkaller myself, rather than being able to integrate it with other
fuzzers say in ARCH=3Dum. Personally, I think it'd be worthwhile to have
that, but I don't see how to integrate it well with this infrastructure.

Also, more generally, it seems unlikely that _anyone_ would ever do
this, and then it's basically only syzbot that will ever run it.
