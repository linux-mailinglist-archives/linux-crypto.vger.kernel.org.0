Yeah, but we'll run into similar issues related to the fact that
scatterlists can describe arbitrary sequences of sub-page size memory
chunks, which means vmap()ing the pages may not be sufficient to get a
virtual linear representation of the buffers.

With zswap being the only current user, which uses a single contiguous
buffers for decompression out of place, and blocks on the completion,
the level of additional complexity we have in the acomp stack is mind
boggling. And the scomp-to-acomp adaptation layer, with its fixed size
per-CPU in and output buffer (implying that acomp in/output has a
hardcoded size limit) which are never freed makes it rather
unpalatable to me tbh.
