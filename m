OK I screwed up that one.  But that's not hard to fix.  We could
simply add request chaining:

	ahash_request_chain(req1, req2);
	ahash_request_chain(req2, req3);
	...
	ahash_request_chain(reqn1, reqn);

	err = crypto_ahash_finup(req1);

Sure you don't need it for two interleaved requests.  But as you
scale up to 16 and beyond, surely at some point you're going to
want to move the hash states off the stack.

We could simply state that these chained requests must be on block
boundaries, similar to how we handle block ciphers.  This is not a
big deal.

The other thing is that verity doesn't benefit from shash at all.
It appears to be doing kmap's on every single request.
