Looking into this a bit more, on RISC-V the kernel actually checks and
records the vector misaligned access speed on each online CPU.  So not
only is RISC-V fragmented in whether this is supported in general, but
it can also be fragmented between different CPUs on the same system.

This means that the status of whether vector misaligned accesses are
supported and fast can change as CPUs go online and offline.

Indeed, there's already a corresponding static key for scalar misaligned
accesses that gets turned on and off as CPUs go online and offline.

But there's none for vector.  And this approach seems fundamentally
broken anyway, as it means that support for misaligned accesses can get
pulled out from underneath users.

I think we'll just need to make the RISC-V crypto code conditional on
CONFIG_RISCV_EFFICIENT_VECTOR_UNALIGNED_ACCESS=y.  Having this info be
statically known, like it is on the other architectures, is the only
reasonable way to do it.
