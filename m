"If the host goes and DMAs into the completely wrong HVA=>PFN, then
that is a host bug; that the bug happened to be exploited by a
buggy/malicious guest doesn't change the fact that the host messed
up."

Again, I'm flabbergasted that you are arguing that it's OK for a guest
to exploit a host bug to take down host-side processes or the host
itself, either of which could bring down all other VMs on the machine.

I'm going to repeat -- this is not OK! Period.

Again, if the community wants to layer some orchestration scheme
between host userspace, host kernel, and guest, on top of the code to
inject the #VC into the guest, that's fine. This proposal is not
stopping that. In fact, the two approaches are completely orthogonal
and compatible.

But so far I have heard zero reasons why injecting a #VC into the
guest is wrong. Other than just stating that it's wrong.

Again, the guest must be able to detect buggy and malicious host-side
writes to private memory. Or else "confidential computing" doesn't
work. Assuming that's not true is not a valid argument to dismiss
injecting a #VC exception into the guest.
