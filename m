That's great!

I do have access to Marvell boards, having the EIP197 & EIP97 engines. I
can help testing your modifications on those boards. Do you have a
public branch somewhere I can access?

I'm happy to see some activity on this driver :) I too was working on
making the boot test suite pass (some tests were not working since the
testmgr rework and improvement), and on performance improvement.

If there is a branch publicly available, I'll be happy to give it a
try.

Thanks,
