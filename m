Please test both little-endian and big-endian. (Note that you don't
need a big-endian user space for this - the self tests are executed
before the rootfs is mounted)

Also, you will have to rebase this onto the latest cryptodev tree,
which carries some changes I made recently to this driver.

Finally, I'd like to discuss whether we really need two separate
drivers here. The 1k data point is not as relevant as the other ones,
which show a worthwhile speedup for all micro architectures and data
sizes (although I will give this a spin on TX2 myself when I have the
chance)

*If* we switch to this implementation completely, I would like to keep
the improvement I added recently to the decrypt path to compare the
tag using SIMD code, rather than copying it out and using memcmp().
Could you look into adopting this for this version as well?
