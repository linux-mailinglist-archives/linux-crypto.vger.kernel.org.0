It is more about not bothering with the extra tracking. We don't
really need it and having it doesn't really add much in the way of
value.

It is also doing the advancing though isn't it?

Yeah, now that I reread it I see that. For some reason I was thinking
you were aligning spfn, not epfn.

I think I resolved this with the fix for it I described in the other
email. We just need to swap out spfn for epfn and make sure we align
spfn with epfn_align. Then I think that takes care of possible skips.

So the problem with aligning down is that you are going to be slowed
up as you have to go single threaded to initialize whatever remains.
So worst case scenario is that you have a section aligned block and
you will process all but 1 section in parallel, and then have to
process the remaining section one max order block at a time.

I agree I am not sure if it will make a big difference on x86, however
the more ranges you have to process the faster this approach should be
as it stays parallel the entire time rather than having to drop out
and process the last section one max order block at a time.

Right. So that was to catch the case where you could potentially align
down below spfn.
