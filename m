But we are only concerned with the application interface.  Do we really
expect that to be different from arc4random_buf and its variants?

The interface between glibc and the kernel can be changed without
impacting applications.

Below you suggest to use GRND_INSECURE to avoid deadlocks during
booting.  It's documented in the UAPI header as =E2=80=9CReturn
non-cryptographic random bytes=E2=80=9D.  I assume it's broadly equivalent =
to
reading from /dev/urandom (which we need to support for backwards
compatibility, and currently use to avoid blocking).  This means that we
cannot really document the resulting bits as cryptographically strong
from an application perspective because the kernel is not willing to
make this commitment.

We can investigate that, but it doesn't change the application
interface.

We don't need any of that in userspace if the staging buffer is managed
by the kernel, which is why the thread-specific data donation is so
attractive as an approach.  The kernel knows where all these buffers are
located and can invalidate them as needed.

I tried to de-escalate here, and clearly that didn't work.  The context
here is that historically, working with the =E2=80=9Crandom=E2=80=9D kernel=
 maintainers
has been very difficult for many groups of people.  Many of us are tired
of those non-productive discussions.  I forgot that this has recently
changed on the kernel side.  I understand that it's taking years to
overcome these perceptions.  glibc is still struggling with this, too.

Regarding the technical aspect, GRND_INSECURE is somewhat new-ish, but
as I wrote above, it's UAPI documentation is a bit scary.  Maybe it
would be possible to clarify this in the manual pages a bit?  I *assume*
that if we are willing to read from /dev/urandom, we can use
GRND_INSECURE right away to avoid that fallback path on sufficiently new
kernels.  But it would be nice to have confirmation.

I had some patches with AT_RANDOM fallback, including overwriting
AT_RANDOM with output from the seeded PRNG.  It's certainly messy.  I
probably didn't bother to post these patches given how bizarre the whole
thing was.  I did have fallback to CPU instructions, but that turned out
to be unworkable due to bugs in suspend on AMD CPUs (kernel or firmware,
unclear).

The ChaCha20 generator we currently have in the tree may not be
required, true.  But this doesn't make what we have today =E2=80=9Cbroken=
=E2=80=9D, it's
merely overly complicated.  And replacing that with a straight buffer
from getrandom does not change the external interface, so we can do this
any time we want.

Not completely, no, but we can cover many cases.  I do not currently see
a way around that if we want to promote arc4random_uniform(limit) as a
replacement for random() % limit.

Again, given the issues around GRND_INSECURE (the reason why it exists),
we do not have much choice on the glibc side.  And these issues will be
there for the foreseeable future, whether glibc provides arc4random or
not.
