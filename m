Some of the LTP tests check for ENOENT to determine whether an algorithm is
intentionally unavailable, as opposed to it failing due to some other error.
There is code in the kernel that does this same check too, e.g.
fs/crypto/keysetup.c and block/blk-crypto-fallback.c.

The way that ELIBBAD is overloaded to mean essentially the same thing as ENOENT,
but only in some cases, is not expected.

It would be more logical for ELIBBAD to be restricted to actual test failures.

If it is too late to change, then fine, but it seems like a bug to me.
