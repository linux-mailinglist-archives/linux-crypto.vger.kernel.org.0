Yes, also if non-root user has access to some key in keyring, he can effectively
use it from another context (for example simulate dmcrypt and decrypt an image
of another user). But this is about policy of storing keys in keyrings.

We use what kernel provides now. If there is a better way, we can switch to it.

The reason for using keyring for dmcrypt was to avoid sending key in plain
in every device-mapper ioctl structure. We use process keyring here, so
the key in keyring actually disappears after the setup utility finished its job.

The patch for crypto API is needed mainly for the "trusted" key type, that we
would like to support in dmcrypt as well. For integration in LUKS we need
to somehow validate that the key for particular dm-crypt device is valid.
If we cannot calculate a key digest directly (as LUKS does), we need to provide
some operation with the key from userspace (like HMAC) and compare known output.

This was the main reason for this patch. But I can imagine a lot of other
use cases where key in keyring actually simplifies things.
