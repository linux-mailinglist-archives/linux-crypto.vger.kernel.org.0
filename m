You're right, the buffering has the disadvantage, that the random data for the non-first callers are not fresh. But if we only want to have fresh data here, we should avoid this call in interrupt context completely (see below).

It is true, that the performance of the instruction is not really relevant, but only for calls outside of an interrupt context. I did some ftrace logging for the s390_random_get_seed_long() calls, and - as you said - there are a few calls per minute. But there was also some repeating calls in interrupt context. On systems with a huge interrupt load, this can cause severe performance impacts. I've no concrete performance measurements at the moment, but - as I said - the trng instruction on s390 takes a lot of time and in interrupt context the interrupts are disabled for the complete runtime of the instruction.

The optimization of the trng calls was not the main goal, but we (Harald and I) thought about how can we provide trng data to in-interrupt callers as well, without doing the trng instruction call in the interrupt context itself. At the moment, I don't see any possibility to do both, fresh data and prevent trng calls in interrupt context BUT provide trng data for in-interrupt-callers. But I'm always open for new ideas.

If the data must be fresh, I would propose not to use any trng-generated data for in-interrupt callers.
