It is correct, but is it smart?

Either we require the same IV to be passed twice as we do today, in which c=
ase
passing different IV should fail in a predictable manner OR we should defin=
e
the operation is taking two IV like structures - one as the IV and one as
bytes in the associated data and have the IPsec code use it in a specific w=
ay of
happen to pass the same IV in both places.

I don't care either way - but right now the tests basically relies on
undefined behaviour
which is always a bad thing, I think.
