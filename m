The kernel uses -fno-delete-null-pointer-checks.

As for the caller side, isn't it the expected behavior?  NULL isn't
at_least n, unless n == 0 (see below).

There isn't any reason to use it on an array parameter with size 0,
though.  Unless someone uses it on a VLA where the size is a previous
function parameter, but that's not what this is wanted for.

While it would be helpful to get a warning in the second case too, the
first case is already helpful (and more important anyway).

It seems the ship already sailed decades ago, though: [n] has always
been "advisory" in C.  [static n] is needed to make it be enforced, and
surely it was done that way for backwards compatibility.

Perhaps people would like to volunteer to get gcc and clang to provide
an option to provide nonstandard behavior where [n] is enforced, and
then push to get the C standard revised to specify that behavior.  It
sounds great to me, but that would of course be a very long project.

In the mean time, we don't need to delay using the tool we have now.

No.  That would be more code, would double the API size, and make it the
caller's responsibility to decide which one to call.  And often there
won't be a correct option, as the caller may have arrays that are larger
than the required size, or a mix of arrays and pointers, etc.
