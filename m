A while ago, I benchmarked the QCE on an older SoC, and it was much slower than
just using the ARMv8 crypto extensions.  So I'm not surprised.  I don't think
QCE is really used anymore.  But almost everyone uses ICE.

I'm already using your v5.10-rc3 branch, but ninges_defconfig isn't working for
me.  (Though I couldn't find the firmware file "qcom/a530_zap.elf", so I had to
remove it from CONFIG_EXTRA_FIRMWARE.)  Instead I'm using a kconfig based on
https://github.com/SoMainline/linux/blob/marijn/android/arch/arm64/configs/defconfig
which is working for me.

I haven't been able to get a full Android userspace to work, and currently I'm
instead just replacing the kernel in a TWRP image and booting into recovery.
It's enough to get adb shell access and chroot into a Debian chroot on the
userdata partition, which is enough to run android-xfstests to test the ICE
support.  Earlier I tried AOSP using the instructions at
https://developer.sony.com/develop/open-devices/guides/aosp-build-instructions/build-aosp-android-android-11-0-0,
and also LineageOS using the instuctions at
https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/kirin/build, but neither worked.  That was a
couple weeks ago though, so I haven't tried the very latest kernel with full
Android.  Let me know if you have any suggestions!

Thanks,

- Eric
