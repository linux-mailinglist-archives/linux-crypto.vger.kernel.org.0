As requested off-list, here are some (micro)benchmark results for this
series.  The CPU was AMD Ryzen 9 9950X.  The server was Samba running on
localhost.  Message signing was enabled.  A valid username and password
were given in the mount options.  The "Improvement" column is the
percent change in throughput (reciprocal cycles):

           ==============               ======      =====   ===========

    1. Total cycles spent in             44548      20081      122%
    smb311_update_preauth_hash()
    during SMB 3.1.1 mount
    (4 calls total)

    2. setup_ntlmv2_rsp() cycles         31777      22231       43%

    3. Total cycles spent in             17802      22876      -22%
    generate_key()

    (3 calls total)

    4. Total cycles spent in            205110      87204      135%
    smb2_calc_signature()
    during SMB 2.0 mount
    (26 calls & 3316 bytes total)

    5. Total cycles spent in          22689767   21043125        8%
    smb2_calc_signature()
    reading 10MB file using SMB 2.0
    (316 calls & 10031077 bytes total)

    6. Total cycles spent in             56803      37840       50%
    cifs_calc_signature()
    during SMB 1.0 mount
    (18 calls & 1551 bytes total)

    7. Total cycles spent in          52669066   51974573        1%
    cifs_calc_signature()
    reading 10MB file using SMB 1.0
    (336 calls & 10021426 bytes total)

    8. parse_mf_symlink() cycles          7654       4902       56%

Note: case 3 regressed because the "cmac(aes)" allocation moved from
smb311_update_preauth_hash (case 1) to generate_key (case 3).  Excluding
that allocation, generate_key got faster.  Likewise, the sum of cases 1,
2, and 3 (which all occurred at mount time) got faster.

There was a greater speedup in signature calculation than I expected.
It's probably because many SMB messages are short (especially the ones
exchanged at mount time), and also because the old code allocated new
crypto_shash objects more frequently than I had thought.  The SMB 2.0
code allocated a new "hmac(sha256)" crypto_shash for every other message
signed.  That overhead is all gone after switching to the library.

TLDR: all SMB crypto calculations (SHA-512, HMAC-SHA256, MD5, HMAC-MD5)
affected by this series are faster now.  The library APIs fix the
unnecessary overhead that the traditional crypto API has.  Of course,
it's also a lot easier to use as well.
