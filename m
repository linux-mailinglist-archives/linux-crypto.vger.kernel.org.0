With the current approach of preempt_v we still need
kernel_vector_begin/end to explicitly mark enabled sections. But
indeed, preempt_v will make it easy to do function-wise, thread-wise
enable if people need it.

Yes, I think we can split. It will introduce some overhead on my side,
but at least we can get some parts moving. I was preempted by some
higher priority tasks. Luckily I am back now. Please expect v4 by next
week, I hope it won't be too late for the cycle.
