The main goal is to remove the legacy cipher type, and replacing
it with lskcipher.  The vaddr interface is simply a bonus.  In fact
this particular series is basically my response to your questions
about adiantum from that thread:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-crypto/20230914082828.895403-1-herbert@gondor.apana.org.au/

But yes I will update the cover letter.

That's a question for each user to decide.

In general, if the amount of data being processed is large, then
I would expect the use of hardware accelerators to be a possibility
and therefore choose the SG-based interface.

I wouldn't consider 4K to be large though.  So it's really when you
feed hundreds of kilobytes of data through the algorithm when I would
recommend against using shash.

Right, there is no reason why we couldn't extend this to more than
two passes when the need arises.  The CCM algorithm could also be
implemented in this manner with three passes (although the first
pass is a bit of a waste since it simply tallies up the length of
the input).
