The only case where you can use LMS/XMSS in software is if you perform
exclusively verification, or if you perform a small number of
signatures and then immediately destroy the private key.

LMS/and XMSS absolutely cannot be used as software algorithms to
generate signatures while keeping a key around because ensuring the
status is never reused is fundamentally impossible in software. And a
single reuse in LMS/XMSS means complete breakdown of the crypto-system.

Due to the above in general implementing LMS/XMSS signature generation
in software is a *very bad idea*(TM) because people do not understand
how it can be used safely, and I would seriously discourage it.

The next option in this line of thought is SLH-DSA (which I would favor
if not for the following).

The problems with SLH-DSA are that it has rather large signatures and
is the slowest of all the algorithms and that CNSA 2.0 does not list
SLH-DSA as approved :-(

To be honest it does not really matter, either we'll have a workable
quantum computer or not, if we do we do, and the scaling will be rapid
enough that the difference in required bits won't really matter. I find
it very unlikely that we'll find ourselves in a situation where we'll
have a QC that can efficiently performer the Grover's algorithm with
enough bits, and yet implementing Shor's one is too hard and will take
a decade or more to reach.

What I believe is that we should not worry about Grover, because if we
get a workable Grover implementation that works we'll get Shor's too
which breaks clsssic algorithms entirely. Therefore we better move to
PQ algorithms and not spend time on a "small transition".

Of course we can decide to hedge *all bets* and move to a composed
signature (both a classic and a PQ one), in which case I would suggest
looking into signatures that use ML-DSA-87 + Ed448 or ML-DSA-87 + P-521
,ideally disjoint, with a kernel policy that can decide which (or both)
needs to be valid/checked so that the policy can be changed quickly via
configuration if any of the signature is broken.

This will allow for fears of Lattice not being vetted enough to be
managed as well as increasing the strength of the classic option, while
maintaining key and signature sizes manageable.
