That's fantastic!

CRC64 isn't deprecated, and I suspect that will be our preferred option
at some point in the future. xxHash was added only because there is a
real desire for 64 bit checksums and crc64 wasn't a good option at the
time.

(It was also designed as a hash function, not for data protection, and
I'd want to see some actual literature evaluating it as such before I'd
consider making it the default. And like I mentioned, CRCs have other
properties we want).
