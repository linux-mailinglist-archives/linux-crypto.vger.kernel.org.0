Are there any specific examples that you could give?

'tested' is set before the algorithm has actually been tested, and it sounds
like the same as CRYPTO_ALG_TESTED which already exists.  Maybe it should be
called something else, like 'test_started'?

Is there a way to continue iterating from the previous algorithm, so that this
doesn't take quadratic time?

A comment explaining why the tests aren't run until late_initcall would be
helpful.  People shouldn't have to dig through commit messages to understand the
code.

Also, did you check whether there is anything that relies on the crypto API
being available before or during late_initcall?  That wouldn't work with this
new approach, right?
