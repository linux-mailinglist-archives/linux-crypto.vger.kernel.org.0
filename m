Thank you for the explanation.

Yes, for all other users.

But if you are planning to enable this option for all Android devices across 
the board I am not sure here. In this case, wouldn't it make sense to require 
capable(CAP_SYS_ADMIN) for the DRBG reset operation just as an additional 
precaution? Note, the issue with the reset is that you loose all previous 
state (which is good for testing, but bad for security as I guess you agree 
:-) ).

So, I should then dust off my AF_ALG KPP and AF_ALG akcipher patches then? :-D
