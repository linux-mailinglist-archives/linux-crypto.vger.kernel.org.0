crypto_lskcipher_crypt_sg() assumes that a single en/decryption operation can be
broken up into multiple ones.  I think you're arguing that since there's no
"init" or "final", these sub-en/decryptions aren't analogous to "update" but
rather are full en/decryptions that happen to combine to create the larger one.
So sure, looking at it that way, the input/output IV does make sense, though it
does mean that we end up with the confusing "output IV" terminology as well as
having to repeat any setup code, e.g. HChaCha, that some algorithms have.
