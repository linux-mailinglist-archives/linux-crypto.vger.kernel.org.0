Not forgotten, but the Zvkb extension did not exist when the patchset
was merged.
RISC-V extension support is typically merged when specifications are "froze=
n".
This means a high bar for changes, but they are possible until the
spec is ratified.
Often nothing is changed until ratification, but here Zvkb has been
(re-)introduced.

I was not aware of this untils I read this email, so I just wrote a
patch that fills the gap:
  https://sourceware.org/pipermail/binutils/2023-November/130762.html

Thanks for reporting!
