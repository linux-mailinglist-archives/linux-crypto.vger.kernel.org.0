I often leave stable@vger.kernel.org in the email Cc list, and no one has ever
complained.  It's only sending patches directly "To:" stable@vger.kernel.org
that isn't allowed, except when actually sending out backports.

If there were people who had an actual issue with Cc, then I think the rules
would have changed long ago to using some other tag like Backport-to that
doesn't get picked up by git send-email.
