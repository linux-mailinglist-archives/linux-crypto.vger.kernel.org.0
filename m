You haven't answered this question yet. I suppose you just slapped a
different license text on this file, one that already existed in
lib/mpi?

Do any of these modifications resemble the changes made to the GnuPG
versions of these routines?

That is fine, provided that none of our modifications were taken from
the GnuPG version of this file without giving credit.
