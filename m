That was basically *my* point. But you're welcome to use it :-)

As I explained before, what appears synchronous to a single userland
process may look very differently from the OS and h/w perspective. But
of course, I take your point that h/w is not faster than the CPU in
the general case, and so care must be taken.

This is made worse by the priority scheme, which does not really
convery information like this.

Spoken like a true h/w guy :-)

Our crypto s/w stack and the storage, networking and other subsystems
that are layered on top of it are complex enough that we shouldn't try
to cater for non-compliant hardware. This is why you need to fix this
in your driver: to prevent the issue from leaking into other layers,
making it even more difficult to do testing and validation.
