I am surprised that calculating the value in zswap_store() causes a
regression, but I am fine with keeping the precalculation in this case.

I think there's a bigger problem here tho, more below.

I saw your other response as well, but I think one thing is not clear
here. The zswap entry will get written back "eventually", sure, but
that's not the problem.

If the zswap entry is on the wrong node lru, two things happen:
(a) When the "right" node is under memory pressure, we cannot free this
    entry by writing it back since it's not available in the lru.
(b) When the "wrong" node is under memory pressure, it will potentially
    writeback entries from other nodes AND report them as being freed
    from this node.

Both (a) and (b) cause less effective reclaim from the zswap shrinker.
Additionally (b) causes the shrinker to report the wrong amount of freed
memory from the node. While this may not be significant today, it's very
possible that more heuristics start relying on this number in the
future.

I don't believe we should put zswap entries on the wrong LRU, but I will
defer to Nhat for the final verdict if he has a different opinion.

Taking a step back, based on discussions in this thread and others, it
seems like the performance of zswap_store() is very sensitive to minor
changes like this one, calculating the store size, etc.

I don't recall this being the case before this patch series. It seems
like an artifact of batching affecting performance negatively and
a collection of micro-optimizations and "correct" placement of code/data
to fix it. This seems to be very fragile.

It is very possible that an incoming change will move the
initializations or make other changes to the code, that will seemingly
cause regressions when they really shouldn't.

Additionally, what may seem optimal on the CPU you are testing on maybe
be suboptimal for other CPUs. I think the big problem here is not where
to initialize the entry or whether to precompute the store batch size,
it's why the code has become extremely sensitive to these changes when
it shouldn't be. zswap_store() is not a fast path by any means, and
people will not expect such changes to cause meaningful regressions.

I think it's currently misleading in its current form. Perhaps:

The entry is successfully compressed and stored in the tree, and further
failures will be cleaned up in zswap_store().

Right, I missed the part about zswap_store() handling this, the comment
above confused me.
