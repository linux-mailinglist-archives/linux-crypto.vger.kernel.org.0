Apologies for being blunt, but you are basically driving home the
point I made before about why the cipher API should become internal to
the crypto subsystem.

Even though EBOIV is explicitly only intended for accessing old
BitLocker images, you prioritize non-functional properties like API
symmetry and tradition over sound cryptographic engineering practice,
even after I pointed out to you that
a) the way EBOIV uses the same symmetric key for two different
purposes is a bad idea in general, and
b) table based AES in particular is a hazard for this mode, since the
way the IV is generated is susceptible to exactly the attack that
table based AES is most criticized for.

So if you insist on supporting EBOIV in combination with arbitrary
skciphers or AEADs (or AES on systems where crypto_alloc_cipher()
produces a table based AES driver), how do you intend to mitigate
these issues?
