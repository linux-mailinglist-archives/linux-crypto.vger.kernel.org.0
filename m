I agree with this in principle, but couldn't we provide /some/ level
of support in the library so that users don't have to do it, and end
up breaking things, either functionally or in terms of security? The
fact that you yourself have already implemented this in 3+ places
suggests that there may be many other occurrences of this pattern in
the future.

I agree that adding a generic hash API that takes a char[] algo_name
and supports every flavor of hash that we happen to implement is a bad
idea. But perhaps there is some middle ground here, with a build-time
constant mask representing the algorithms that are actually supported
at the call site, so that the compiler can prune the bits we don't
need? I'm asking for the sake of discussion here, though - I don't
have a use case myself where this is needed.

Yeah, that's a good point too.
