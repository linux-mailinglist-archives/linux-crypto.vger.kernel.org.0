From: Eric Biggers <ebiggers@google.com>

Most cryptographic hash functions are serialized, in the sense that they
have an internal block size and the blocks must be processed serially.
(BLAKE3 is a notable exception that has tree-based hashing built-in, but
all the more common choices such as the SHAs and BLAKE2 are serialized.)

This limits the performance of computing a single hash.  Yet, computing
multiple hashes simultaneously does not have this limitation.  Modern
CPUs are superscalar and often can execute independent instructions in
parallel.  As a result, on many modern CPUs, it is possible to hash two
equal-length messages in about the same time as a single message, if all
the instructions are interleaved.

Meanwhile, a very common use case for hashing in the Linux kernel is
dm-verity and fs-verity.  Both use a Merkle tree that has a fixed block
size, usually 4096 bytes with an empty or 32-byte salt prepended.  The
hash algorithm is usually SHA-256.  Usually, many blocks need to be
hashed at a time.  This is an ideal scenario for multibuffer hashing.

Linux actually used to support SHA-256 multibuffer hashing on x86_64,
before it was removed by commit ab8085c130ed ("crypto: x86 - remove SHA
multibuffer routines and mcryptd").  However, it was integrated with the
crypto API in a weird way, where it behaved as an asynchronous hash that
queued up and executed all requests on a global queue.  This made it
very complex, buggy, and virtually unusable.

This patch takes a new approach of just adding an API
crypto_shash_finup2x() that synchronously computes the hash of two
equal-length messages, starting from a common state that represents the
(possibly empty) common prefix shared by the two messages.

The new API is part of the "shash" algorithm type, as it does not make
sense in "ahash".  It does a "finup" operation rather than a "digest"
operation in order to support the salt that is used by dm-verity and
fs-verity.  There is no fallback implementation that does two regular
finups if the underlying algorithm doesn't support finup2x, since users
probably will want to avoid the overhead of queueing up multiple hashes
when multibuffer hashing won't actually be used anyway.

For now the API only supports 2-way interleaving, as the usefulness and
practicality seems to drop off dramatically after 2.  The arm64 CPUs I
tested don't support more than 2 concurrent SHA-256 hashes.  On x86_64,
AMD's Zen 4 is a notable exception that can theoretically do 4
concurrent SHA-256 hashes (at least based on a microbenchmark of the
sha256rnds2 instruction).  However, increasing the interleaving factor
further would involve tradeoffs such as no longer being able to cache
the round constants in registers, further increasing the code size (both
source and binary), further increasing the amount of state that users
need to keep track of, and causing there to be more "leftover" hashes.
