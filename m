Good.

As long as we can show that WireGuard really benefits without
regressing other users disproportionately, I think we're fine. There
are not /that/ many users to begin with ...

No, v5.6. The merge window for v5.5 will open this Sunday, so you'll
need to rebase on v5.5-rc1 once it is released, which will [hopefully]
have all the crypto pieces you need.

Note that this applies equally to the other changes: we can queue
performance tweaks in the crypto tree in parallel, and they will all
hit v5.6 at the same time.
