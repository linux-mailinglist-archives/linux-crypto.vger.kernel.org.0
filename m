Actually, that spec has a couple of test vectors. Unfortunately, they
are all rather short (except the last one in the 'no multiple of 16
bytes' paragraph, but unfortunately, that one is in fact a multiple of
16 bytes)

I added them here [0] along with an arm64 implementation for the AES
instruction based driver. Could you please double check that these
work against your driver? That would establish a ground truth against
which we can implement the generic version as well.

One or two larger ones would be useful, yes.
