Yes, because we have 3 distinct states -
1. No IV in the AAD buffer - "normal"  AEAD.
2. There is a copy of the IV in the AAD buffer and it is NOT used for
ICV computation purposes - RFC4106 and RFC 4309.
3, There is a copy of the IV in the AAD buffer and it is used for ICV
computation purposes - RFC 4543.

3 states needs at least 2 bits.

I will add a remark explaining this.
I chose to keep the "esp_aad" name, since it was there before, but
possibly this is not a good choice in light of your comments so will
change that too.

V.

I believe it isn't a contradiction after all. Consider -

RFC 4106 needs to have a copy of the IV in the AAD buffer which is
identical to the one being passed via the normal mechanism in the API.
If they are not identical, we have no way to know which copy of the IV
is being used by an implementation as part of the AES-GCM nonce and so
the generated message may be different from the one being used by the
generic implementation. which results in encryption test failing when
compared to the generic implementation  results, even though there is
nothing wrong with the tested implementation and indeed the previous
compassion against the precomputed test vectors passes.
This is what happened with the ccree driver. Note that this has
nothing to do with mutating the message - this is an encryption test
failing.
This is the iv_aad flag, which will need to be true in this case.

On the other hand when testing decryption and mutating the AEAD
message, we need to know not to mutate the IV copy in the AAD buffer,
since it is ignored.
This is the esp_aad flag, which will also needs to be true in this case.

Last but not least, RFC 4543 need a copy of the IV in the AAD buffer
However, this copy DOES get hashed as part of the ICV computation, so
-
We need iv_aad flag to be true to let us know we need to copy the IV.
However, we need esp_aad to be false since it's fine and even
desirable to mutate the IV copy in the AAD buffer.

You are correct though that I can make the 2nd copy of the IV post
mutation dependant on esp_aad not being set, though...


I hope this explains this mess better.
It certainly took me a while to figure out what is going on...

You are right, I need to check for that.
However, if it isn't this can't be a legal RFC4106 message and we will
fail encryption .

Thanks!
