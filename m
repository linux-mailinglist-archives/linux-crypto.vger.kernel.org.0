This same patch makes i7 mobile processors able to handle 1Gbps+ software
decrypt rates, where without the patch, the rate was badly constrained and CPU
load was much higher, so it is definitely noticeable on other processors too.
The weak processor on the current test rig is convenient because the problem
is so noticeable even at slower wifi speeds.

We can do some tests on 5.4 with our patch reverted.

Thanks,
