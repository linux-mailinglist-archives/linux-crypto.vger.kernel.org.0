Yes, your chaining API has poor performance and is difficult to test, as I've
been saying all along.

Certainly agreed that chaining is not the way to go, but I think you're
overlooking that Linus's suggestion to use the libraries directly would also
solve this, while also not being restricted to bios and folios (note that not
all filesystems are block-based, for example...).  That would avoid the
per-request overhead from the generic crypto infrastructure, which is the real
source of the problem.

Extending the generic crypto infrastructure to support bios and folios is an
interesting idea.

But TBH I think it's worse than Linus's suggestion of just extending lib/crypto/
to support the needed functionality and using that directly.  Your proposal is
again solving a problem created by the generic crypto infrastructure being too
complex, by making the generic crypto infrastructure even more complex.

With the bio and folio support in the generic crypto infrastructure, there would
be lots of work to do with adding support in all the underlying algorithms, and
adding tests for all the new APIs.

For hashing, users would need to allocate an array to hold the digest for every
block in the bio or folio.  That would add an additional memory allocation to
every I/O.  You said you'd like to fall back to a smaller buffer if the memory
allocation fails.  But that's silly; if we have to support that anyway, we might
as well do it that way only.  In which case the bio interface is pointless.

Also note that the kernel also *already* has an abstraction layer that allows
doing en/decryption on bios.  It's called blk-crypto, and it makes it possible
to do the en/decryption using either inline encryption hardware (i.e., the newer
style of crypto accelerator that is actually commonly used and doesn't use the
Crypto API at all) or the Crypto API.  I have plans to remove the fs-layer bio
en/decryption code from fscrypt and always use blk-crypto instead.

Adding bio support to the Crypto API feels duplicative of blk-crypto, and we'd
end up with too many abstraction layers.  I think my preferred approach is that
blk-crypto-fallback would directly call the library functions.  The legacy
Crypto API really has no useful role to play anymore.

FWIW, there are also people thinking about developing inline hashing hardware,
in which case something similar would apply to blk-integrity.
