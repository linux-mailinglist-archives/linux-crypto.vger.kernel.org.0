Whether this is true is what I am trying to get clarified.

Your patch works around a performance bottleneck related to the use of
AES-NI instructions in the kernel, which has been addressed recently.
If the issue still exists, we can attempt to devise a fix for it,
which may or may not be based on this patch.

Please share performance numbers of an old kernel with this patch
applied, and a recent one without. If that shows there is in fact an
issue, we will do something about it.
