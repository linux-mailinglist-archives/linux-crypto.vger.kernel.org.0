The "non-standard initial value" was just parenthetical -- my thinking
was that revealing the hash, whether the real SHA hash or an
intermediate one starting at some other initial value, shouldn't reveal
the input; not that you get any additional security from being an
intermediate block. But if the hash itself could be sensitive, yeah then
a-h are sensitive anyway.

Ok, I'll just drop the second paragraph from the commit message then.
