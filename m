Looks good to me.

(most closely the first 4 patches)

How do you want to handle merging this? I guess keeping all the patches
together would be good. I have no objection to the mac80211/lib80211
patches going through any arbitrary tree, this code is hardly ever
touched, so highly unlikely to lead to conflicts.
