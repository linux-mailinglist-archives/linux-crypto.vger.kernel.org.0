I don't think that is a realistic expectation.  Decompressors generally need a
contiguous buffer for decompressed data anyway, up to a certain size which is
32KB for DEFLATE but can be much larger for the more modern algorithms.  This is
because they decode "matches" that refer to previously decompressed data by
offset, and it has to be possible to index the data efficiently.

(Some decompressors, e.g. zlib, provide "streaming" APIs where you can read
arbitrary amounts.  But that works by actually decompressing into an internal
buffer that has sufficient size, then copying to the user provided buffer.)

The same applies to compressors too, with regards to the original data.

I think the "input/output is a list of pages" model just fundamentally does not
work well for software compression and decompression.  To support it, either
large temporary buffers are needed (they might be hidden inside the
(de)compressor, but they are there), or vmap() or vm_map_ram() is needed.

FWIW, f2fs compression uses vm_map_ram() and skips the crypto API entirely...

If acomp has to be kept for the hardware support, then maybe its scomp backend
should use vm_map_ram() instead of scratch buffers?
