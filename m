I was going to do something like this originally (but also checking that 'q' is
not "moribund", is a test larval, and has compatible cra_flags).  But I don't
think it will work because a higher priority implementation could be registered
while a lower priority one is being instantiated and tested.  Based on this
logic, when the lower priority implementation finishes being tested,
larval->adult wouldn't be set since a higher priority implementation is still
being tested.  But then cryptomgr_probe() will complete() the larval anyway and
for the user crypto_alloc_foo() will fail with ENOENT.

With my patch the user would get the lower priority implementation in this case,
since it would be the best one ready at the time cryptomgr_probe() finished.
