This is rather unusual compared with how the crypto API is typically
used, but if this is really what you want to implement, you can do so
by:
- having a "ecdh" implementation that implements the entire range, and
uses a fallback for curves that it does not implement
- export the same implementation again as "ecdh" and with a known
driver name "ecdh-keembay-ocs", but with a slightly lower priority,
and in this case, return an error when the unimplemented curve is
requested.

That way, you fully adhere to the API, by providing implementations of
all curves by default. And if a user requests "ecdh-keembay-ocs"
explicitly, it will not be able to use the P192 curve inadvertently.

But policing which curves are secure and which are not is really not
the job of the API. We have implementations of MD5 and RC4 in the
kernel that we would *love* to remove but we simply cannot do so as
long as they are still being used. The same applies to P192: we simply
cannot fail requests for that curve for use cases that were previously
deemed valid. It is perfectly reasonable to omit the implementation
from your hardware, but banning its use outright on the grounds that
is no longer secure conflicts with our requirement not to break
existing use cases.
