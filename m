I don't think they are the same though.  With the existing code,
you only ever have one outstanding request so a new one is only
given over to the hardware after the previous one has completed.
That means that the only errors you expect to get from the driver
are fatal ones that you cannot recover from.

With parallel requests, you will be giving as many requests to
the driver as it can take.  In fact the error condition is now
used to tell the engine to stop giving more requests.  This is
in no way the same as a fatal error from before.

We should not print out an error in this case and we should ensure
that the request is put back on the queue and reprocessed when the
driver comes back for more.

Cheers,
