That would provide the import+finup optimization, but it would retain the
overhead of ahash compared to shash.  That overhead includes a small amount of
extra CPU time as well as the bio size being increased by
sizeof(struct ahash_request).  It's a small difference, but dm-verity
performance is really important.

Note that dm-verity also has to use an ugly and error-prone workaround to use
ahash at all, since its hash blocks can be cached in vmalloc memory; see
verity_hash_update().  shash handles vmalloc memory much more naturally, since
no translation from vmalloc address to page to linear address is needed.

I'm thinking that avoiding the extra overhead of ahash, combined with avoiding
the workaround for vmalloc memory, makes it worthwhile to use shash for the
import+export code path.  If it was just ahash vs. shash by itself, we wouldn't
bother, but the fact that we can combine the two optimizations seems attractive.

This patch limits the use of shash to blocks of at most PAGE_SIZE (*), which is
the same as what ahash does internally.

(*) Except when the data block size is <= PAGE_SIZE but the hash block size is
    > PAGE_SIZE.  I think that's an uncommon configuration that's not worth
    worrying too much about, but it could be excluded from the shash-based code.
