Hi,

Le 26/07/2022 à 15:30, Jason A. Donenfeld via Libc-alpha a écrit :
> Rather than buffering 16 MiB of entropy in userspace (by way of
> chacha20), simply call getrandom() every time.


I dislike the wording because

1) the current buffer is only 512 bytes, not 16MiBytes;
2) implementation reads only 48 bytes of "fresh" entropy from 
getrandom() each 16MiBytes generated.

I'm thinking "stirring" or "streaming" would better describe what's 
happening:

"Rather than stirring 16MiB of random data in userspace before reseeding"

I believe the cloned virtual machine issue should be explicitly 
described as a major blocker in the commit message.

Sure arc4random() interface is inherited from *BSD, thus we're not free 
to improve it. But arc4random() is already here in glibc git, thus I 
think the paragraph is of dubious value in the commit message and can be 
removed.

+ "provided getrandom() and /dev/urandom() could be used in such 
context." ;)


Thanks for the improvements, can't wait for a vDSO getrandom() optimized 
for reading 1,2,4,8 bytes :)
