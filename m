Please try to make the commit logs a bit more summarized. Details are
helpful, but it's easy to lose track of things when it gets too long.

Comments describing specific code paths go out of date really fast. The
comment is probably unnecessary, it's easy to check the allocation path
to figure out that these are zero-initialized.

Also in general, please keep the comments as summarized as possible, and
only when the logic is not clear from the code.

I don't understand what's wrong with the current flow? We call
cpuhp_state_remove_instance() in pool deletion before freeing up the
per-CPU resources. Why is this not enough?
