Then refer to that one linear buffer with one SGL entry.

There is no need to split a string. All that is said is that the SGL needs to 
point to memory that is AAD||PT or AAD||CT||TAG. There is no statement about 
the number of SGL entries to point to these buffer(s). So you could have one 
linear buffer for these components pointing to it with an SGL holding one 
entry.
