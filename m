So why not drop ahash and always use shash? Does anybody care about
offload for dm-verity?

Alternatively, we could incorporate this into ahash itself.  Then
you could have an optimised code path that does not do SGs if the
underlying algorithm is shash.

I really do not wish to see this ahash/shash paradigm proliferate.

OK.  But we do still have the module signature verification code
path and I think that one still needs the can-sleep flag.
