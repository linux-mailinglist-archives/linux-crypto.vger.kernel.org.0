I understand it can be convenient, it's just a matter of having a
logging message for you that will end up in many builds for many users.
They do not necessarily have the same needs. So it's a matter of
compromise, one or two messages at boot can be OK, more is likely to
become an issue.

There are *always* other examples in the kernel :)

Sure. I would say adding one message at boot like this one seems OK. But
the others would need to be debugging messages.

If the drivers fails to probe, there will be other messages. In that
case is this one really needed? I'm not sure.

In case of failure you'll need anyway to debug and understand what's
going on. By adding new prints, or enabling debugging messages.

That right, whatever you prefer then.

Using the same argument I would say the way the device is accessed is
very run-time dependent, and it has nothing to do with the version of
the h/w (the same engine could be accessed through different ways given
the platform).

Maybe the name 'feature' is too specific, I agree with you.

That would be an issue with the driver. We named the 'version' given the
knowledge we had of the h/w, it might not be specific enough. Or maybe
you can think of this as being a "family of engine versions". The idea
is the version is what the h/w is capable of, not how it's being
wired/accessed.

It may complain with --strict on this one. (Well, I'm sure many --strict
tests won't pass on the existing upstream code, no worries :)).

The simple answer is: everybody set the \n, so at least for consistency
we should have them.

Compatibles are used in device trees, which intend to be a description
of the hardware (not the configuration of how the hardware should be
used). So we can't have a compatible being a restricted configuration
use of a given hardware. But I think here you're right, and there is
room for a more generic eip197 compatible: the b/d versions only have
few differences and are part of the same family, so we can have a very
specific compatible plus a "family" one. Something like:

  compatible = "inside-secure,safexcel-eip197d", "inside-secure,safexcel-eip197";

This would need to be in a separated patch, and this should be
documented in:
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/crypto/inside-secure-safexcel.txt

Yes, it is the issue. We generally use a sentence instead of function
names (something alongside s/_/ / :)).

OK, that makes sense. If the register accessed is within the register
bank of the crypto engine you can keep this.

My bad, I realise there's a mistake in my comment. That should have
been: you should protect all the PCI specific functions and definitions
with #if IS_ENABLED(...). When part of a function should be excluded
you can use if(IS_ENABLED(...)), but if the entire function can be left
out, #if is the way to go.

Thanks!
