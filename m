I meant repeatable in the sense that the same bug is hit, even if the generated
test case is not 100% identical.

Anyway, you're welcome to send a patch changing the fuzzing code to use a
constant seed, if you really think it would be useful and can provide proper
justification for it.  I'm not sure why you keep sending these long rants, when
you could simply send a patch yourself.

Being too lazy to add a test vector isn't really an excuse, and it won't bloat
the kernel size or boot time unless you add a massive number of test vectors or
if they use very large lengths.  We could even make certain test vectors
conditional on CONFIG_CRYPTO_MANAGER_EXTRA_TESTS if it's an issue...

Like I said, if you encounter bugs that the fuzz tests should be finding but
aren't, it would be really helpful if you added test vectors for them and/or
updated the fuzz tests to generate those cases more often.  I was simply
pointing out that to do the latter, we don't really need to split the tests into
2 parts; it would be sufficient just to change the probabilities with which
different things are generated.  Note that the probabilities can be conditional
on other things, which can get around the issue where a bunch of small
independent probabilities are multiplied together.
