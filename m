Strictly speaking, we (and probably most other HW vendors as well) don't do=
=20
that for every register bit either, not even in the official Programmer Man=
ual.=20
Some bits are just "you don't need to know, just write this" :-)

But I get your point.

Now we're reaching a tricky subject. Because I think if some people here
find out those token bits are explicitly documented in the driver, they
will not be so happy ... (don't worry, I won't wake any sleeping dogs :-)
We provide this information to our customers under NDA, but it's=20
obviously quite sensitive information as it reveals a lot about the
inner workings of our HW design.

The encoding of the microengine control words is considered even
more sensitive, so we don't even provide that under NDA.
Adding that to the driver will probably get me in trouble.

So maybe putting these images in /lib/firmware is unavoidable, but
I'd really like to hear some more opinions on that subject.
