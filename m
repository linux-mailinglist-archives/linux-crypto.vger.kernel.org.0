Hi Seth, Dan, Vitaly, Herbert,

Using crypto_comp APIs, zswap is not able to use the hardware accelators which
are only ported to cryto_acomp nowadays. So Mahipal Challa tried to solve this
problem by the below patch a long time ago:
mm: zswap - Add crypto acomp/scomp framework support [1]

At that time, the test was based on acomp with scomp backend. It was not a real
async platform. On a platform with real acomp support like hisilicon-zip, the
patch will lead to serious "sleep on atomic" issues.

To leverage the power of hardware accelerator, right now, I am sending a new patch
which will remove the atomic context and permit crypto to sleep in zswap.

Literally, using an async compressor, people can dynamically allocate acomp_req and
queue those requests to acrytp drivers, and finally use the callback to notify
the completion of compression/decompression. but this will require dynamic memory
allocation and various synchronizations in zswap, and it is too complex.

Alternatively, this patch pre-allocates the acomp_req with the same number of CPUs.
For each acomp_req, one mutex and one wait are bound with it. The mutex is used
for the race protection of the acomp_req and other percpu resources. Even though
the preempt-disabled atomic context is replaced by sleepable context, threads
might migrate, but the mutex can still protect the race between CPUs for same
resources.

Tested on hisilicon zip driver on a SMP enviorment and on lz4 scomp-based acomp
as well. To use scomp-based acomp, another patch I sent before is needed:
crypto: acomp - search acomp with scomp backend in crypto_has_acomp [2]
