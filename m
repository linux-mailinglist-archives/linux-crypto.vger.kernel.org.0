I don't think the situation is that bad. We only support allocations
in the linear map for DMA/scatterlists, and buffers in the linear map
can only share a cacheline if they were allocated using the same
kmalloc() invocation (on systems that support non-coherent DMA)

That does mean that it is actually more straightforward to deal with
this at the level where the allocation occurs, and that would justify
dealing with it in the callers.

However, from the callee's point of view, it simply means that you
should not dereference any request struct pointers for writing while
the 'dst' scatterlist is mapped for DMA.

As I said, I am on the fence. I think there are arguments for both sides ...
