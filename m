This was changed a while ago, in v5.6.  /dev/random no longer recognizes
O_NONBLOCK because it no longer blocks, except before the entropy pool has been
initialized.

(I don't know why O_NONBLOCK stopped being recognized *before* the entropy pool
has been initialized; it's either an oversight, or it was decided it doesn't
matter.  Probably the latter, since I can't think of a real use case for using
O_NONBLOCK on /dev/random.)

The random(4) man page is indeed in need of an update, not just for this reason
but for some other reasons too.

The util-linux code which you mentioned is opening /dev/random with O_NONBLOCK
if opening /dev/urandom fails, which is pretty much pointless.  Perhaps the
author thought that /dev/random with O_NONBLOCK is equivalent to /dev/urandom
(it's not).  The glibc code, if you mean sysdeps/mach/hurd/getrandom.c, is
actually code written for GNU Hurd, not for Linux, so it's not relevant.
