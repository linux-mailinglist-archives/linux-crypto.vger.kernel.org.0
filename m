Ah.  I wasn't sure if using PAGE_SIZE as trying to help avoid
measurement inaccuracies or make it work more like the real thing
(maybe the code that calls XOR often does it PAGE_SIZE at a time?)  I
definitely haven't played with it, but I could sorta imagine it making
some small differences.  Maybe the "prefetch" versions of the XOR ops
have some overhead but the overhead is mitigated with larger
operations?  Though both 4K and 64K are probably large enough and
probably it wouldn't affect the outcome of which algorithm is best...

Seems OK to me.  Seems unlikely that super fast machine are going to
have a 32 kHz backed k_time and the worst case is that we'll pick a
slightly sub-optimal xor, I guess.  I assume your goal is to keep
things fitting in a 32-bit unsigned integer?  Looks like if your use
1000 it also fits...
