Yes, and in both cases, irq_fpu_usable() will return true, unless RX
and TX are running on the same core.

I can see how in the general case, this is something you would prefer
to avoid. However, on SMP x86_64 systems that implement AES-NI (which
runs at ~1 cycle per byte), I don't see this as a real problem for
this driver.

What we could do is expose both versions, where the async version has
a slightly higher priority, so that all users that do support the
async interface will get it, and the wifi stack can use the sync
interface instead.
