Oh, indeed, I can confirm that. FFDHE calculations are quite time-consuming.
But incidentally, ECDH and curve25519 are reasonably fast, so maybe
there _is_ a value in having a TPAR asking for them to be specified, too ...

Frankly, I hadn't looked at exponential reuse; this implementation
really is just a first step to get feedback from people if this is a
direction they want to go.

Thanks for the hint. I'll be adding exponential reuse to the code.

That is true; exchange timeouts are missing. Will be adding them, of
course. And haven't thought of checking for tl size overflows; will be
adding them, too.

This is something I'll need to look at, anyway. What we do not want is a
userspace application chipping in and send a 'negotiate' command without
any subsequent steps, thereby invalidating the existing authentication.

That indeed would be good; let me think on how something like that can
be implemented.
