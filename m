Hi Jason

Thank for your patience.

To answer your question, yes, we do have a userspace program reading 
/dev/random during early boot which relies on O_NONBLOCK. And this 
change do breaks it. The userspace program comes from 4.4 era, and as 
4.4 is going EOL, we are switching to 5.10 and the breakage is reported.

It would be great if the kernel is able to restore this flag for 
backward compatibility.
