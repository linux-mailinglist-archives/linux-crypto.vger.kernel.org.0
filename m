 		if (!reseed)
 			entropylen = ((entropylen + 1) / 2) * 3;

-> Entropylen is 384 in case of a security strength of 256 bits.

Your code does the following if the Jitter RNG is not allocated (i.e. in non-
fips mode):

ret = drbg_get_random_bytes(drbg, entropy, entropylen + strength);

so: entropylen + strength = 384 + 256, no?

I see in the code path with the Jitter RNG:

ret = crypto_rng_get_bytes(drbg->jent, entropy,
 						   entropylen);

--> 384 bits from the Jitter RNG

ret = drbg_get_random_bytes(drbg, entropy + entropylen,
+						    strength);

--> 256 bits from get_random_bytes

What am I missing here?

Agreed, the existing does does exactly the same with the exception that it
pulls 384 bits from get_random_bytes instead of 640 in non-FIPS mode (i.e.
when the Jitter RNG is not allocated).

In FIPS mode, the current code draws 384 bits from get_random_bytes and
separately 384 bits from the Jitter RNG. So, each data block from either
entropy source could completely satisfy the SP800-90A requirement.

Agreed, but what is your code doing different than the existing code?

There is no need to have a personalization string or additional input. Note,
those two values are intended to be provided by a caller or some other
environment.

If you want to stuff more seed into the DRBG, you simply enlarge the seed
buffer and pull more from the entropy sources. I have no objections doing
that. All I am trying to point out is that the 90A standard does not require
more entropy than 256 bits during initialization plus 128 bits of nonce == 384
bits of data. But the DRBGs all allow providing more data as seed.

Are you saying the order of data from the entropy sources matters in the
entropy buffer? I have not seen that in the standard, but if you say this is
the goal, then allow me to understand which order you want to see?

The current code contains the order of:

<384 bits get_random_bytes> || <384 bits Jitter RNG>
