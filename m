Oh, so that's when syzbot first turned on XFS V5 format testing?

Or was that done in April, when this issue was first reported?

I just looked at it - all it does is create a new file. It's
effectively "mount; touch", which is exactly what I said earlier
in the thread should reproduce this issue every single time.

*sigh*

Did you think to look at the coverage results to check why the
numbers for XFS, ext4 and btrfs are all at 1%? Why didn't the low
number make you dig a bit deeper to see if the number was real or
whether there was a test execution problem during measurement?

I just spent a minute doing exactly that, and the answer is
pretty obvious. Both ext4 and XFS had a mount attempts
rejected at mount option parsing, and btrfs rejected a device scan
ioctl. That's it. Nothing else was exercised in those three
filesystems.

Put simply: the filesystems *weren't tested during coverage
measurement*.

If you are going to do coverage testing, please measure coverage
over *thousands* of different tests performed on a single filesystem
type. It needs to be thousands, because syzbot tests are so shallow
and narrow that actually covering any significant amount of
filesystem code is quite difficult....

-Dave.
