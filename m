Thanks for sharing your patches.

Could you please help me why replacing an async method with a sync method is 
helpful? Which problems do you see with the async method that are alleviated 
with the swtich to the sync method? In general, an async method is more 
powerful, though it requires a bit more code.

Just as a side note not against your ideas and patches, but in general: IMHO 
it is a failure of all of us that the quite sensitive (re)seeding of RNGs and 
entropy management is handled in multiple places in the kernel - and each case 
only handles a subset of considerations around that topic. Note, (re)seeding 
may be needed in other occasions than the elapse of a timer or the reaching of 
maximum number of generate operations. Seeding belongs to a central place 
where it is done right once and usable for differnent RNGs as proposed with my 
LRNG patch set and the published todo list to get rid of the entire seeding 
logic in the DRBG code base.

That said, your patch of adding the timer-based reseeding seems appropriate 
and thus should be considered for the current code base.

Ciao
Stephan
