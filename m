In fact, this is what I started out doing, i.e., factor out the core
arc4 code into crypto/arc4_lib.c, and make the existing driver a thin
wrapper around it, so that we can invoke the library directly.

Yes, that seems highly unlikely.

Without having looked in too much detail, ESSIV seems like something
that could be moved into the crypto subsystem, and be implemented as a
template.
