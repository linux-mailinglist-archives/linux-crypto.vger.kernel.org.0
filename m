Sure, can do. My reasoning was that the target absolutely has to support
the hash functions specified in the PSK, so that will be a safe bet to
choose for the hash function in the protocol itself.
(Any other hash function _might_ not be preset on the target.)
But if the PSK does not specify a hash the target need to pick one; and
for that of course we can use SHA512.
