I believe that what Mark is saying when he says you should change the
arch hooks is that you should change the interface between the core code
and the architecture code to separate the runtime and early init
interfaces with the goal of making it clear the separation between the
two.

Again Mark can correct me if I'm wrong here but anything that isn't
the arch code or the core random code.

The biggest issue here is one of reviewability and maintainability
around early use of the capabilities code.  Without being really up to
speed on those interfaces it can be hard to tell what conditions are
true when and what interfaces are safe to use at any given point in boot
which makes things harder to work with.  This is especially true when we
start to mix in things like preemption disables which also need a lot of
attention.  Avoiding mixing code that needs to run in both init and
normal runtime contexts in the same function makes things easier to
understand.

Looking briefly at the random code you may find that the existing
add_device_randomness() is already close to the arch_add_foo_entropy()
suggested by Mark if not actually good enough, data injected with that
is not going to be credited as entropy but it will feed into the pool.
