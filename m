It depends on what you are casting. But doing something like

u32 l = ...
__le32 ll = (__force __le32)l

should not trigger a sparse warning.

If you are using the generic aes_expandkey and want to reuse the key
schedule, it is indeed good to be aware that both the round keys
themselves as well as the key length are recorded in CPU endianness.

Endianness always matters, and both AES and ChaCha are rather similar
in that respect in the sense that it is the algorithm that defines how
a byte stream is mapped onto 32-bit words, and in both cases, they use
little endianness.

Only if API means the AES or ChaCha specific helper routines that we
have in the kernel. If you are using the AES helpers, then yes, you
need to ensure that you use the same convention. But the algorithms
themselves are fully defined by their specification, and so what other
implementations in the kernel do is not really relevant.
