Sure, IPs get reused and can show up in newer SoCs though.  My observation was
just meant to emphasize that that's unlikely here.

It's significant on short lengths, which are common.  ext4 metadata_csum passes
a lot of 4-byte lengths to crc32c(), for example.  Fiddling with a spin lock,
linked list, runtime pm, and hardware registers to process 4 bytes is an awful
lot of work for something that could have just been a few table lookups.

Right, that specific bug might be harmless, but it's still an example of an
issue that is not possible with software CRC code.

Sure, but an alternate approach would be to wire up this driver to
arch/arm/lib/crc32.c.  I just wanted to elaborate on why this driver seems
pretty useless, possibly even harmful, and is better off just removed for now.
