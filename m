Even if it does sometimes use the same core, if performance is better and
CPU usage is lower, why would it even matter?

Anyway, looks like Herbert is dead set against this code in hopes that he
can force other subsystems to re-write their code.  If you come up with
some other variant that Herbert will accept, let me know and I'll test it.

Otherwise, I will just add your patch to my kernel and carry on.

Thanks,
Ben
