Sure, I will send a patch on top with that.

IIUC, the normal flow is:

1. amd_iommu_init() -> snp_rmptable_init() // previously snp_prepare()
1. kvm load
1. ccp load, /dev/sev created  // now snp_prepare()
1. kvm_amd load, sev_init()
1. kvm_x86_vendor_init() -> sev_hardware_setup()
1. kvm_init() -> kvm_arch_enable_virtualization_cpu() ->
       svm_enable_virtualization_cpu() -> HSAVE_PA = $real_pa

So the happy path works fine. The problem is if e.g. the first
snp_prepare() fails, userspace can do ioctl(/dev/sev, SEV_PDH_GEN, ...)
or try to start an SNP VM, which will unconditionally do
sev_platform_init(). Both of those trigger the snp_prepare() again,
and you can't run normal VMs.

IMO if you fail SNP init once, you probably will again. I was
suggesting setting psp_dead to just kill everything.

But the real issue is that late-SNP initialization is problematic.
I'll see if there's some way we can figure out if we're in that path
and forbid it.

Thanks for applying it. I have a stack of patches from this and my own
review-prompts use that I'm testing now, but they are just the simple
fixes. I'll work on trying to make things a little for the future
too...
