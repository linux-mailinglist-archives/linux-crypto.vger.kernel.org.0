That looks reasonable, if Clang's 8 unrolled crc32q is faster per byte
then you either need to unroll once (no point doing any more) or use
the loop that does negative offsets from the end.

That is gcc being brain-dead again.
It pretty much refuses to use a loop-updated pointer (%rax above)
and recalculates it from the count.
At least it is a single instruction here and there are the extra
register don't cause a spill to stack.

I'll find the code loop I use - machine isn't powered on at the moment.

Well, provided the branches aren't mispredicted it'll be limited by
the crc32b - so three clocks per byte, max 27
The 4-2-1 stepdown needs the extra address update but that may not cost
and is then max 9 clocks. Also a lot less I-cache.
The code logic may not matter unless the buffer is short.
I think the cpu will be executing the tail instructions while many
of the crc32 from the main loop are still queued waiting results
from earlier instructions (especially if you get a loop that would
run in two clocks with (say) addq instead of crc32q.

The byte loop should be limited by the crc32b. So probably as fast
as that unrolled mess, although it will always have a mispredicted
branch (or two) - I suspect all loops do.
