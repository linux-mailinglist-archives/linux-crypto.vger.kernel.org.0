hm... just thinking out loud, but maybe the right say to go is to not
have a build dependency,
but add some user assistance code in cryptosetup that parses
/proc/crypto after failures to
try and suggest the user with a way forward?

e.g. if eboiv mapping initiation fails, scan /proc/crypto and either
warn of a lack of AES
or, assuming some instance of AES is found, warn of lack of EBOIV.
It's a little messy
and heuristic code for sure, but it lives in a user space utility.

Does that sound sane?
