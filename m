I'm avoiding adding it in the first place.

You cannot ignore complexity in the API, as that is the worst kind.

In addition, your (slower) solution has a large amount of complexity in the
per-algorithm glue code, making it still more lines of code *per algorithm* than
my (faster) solution, which you're ignoring.

Also, users still have to queue up multiple requests anyway.  There are no
"unnecessary hoops" with my patches -- just a faster, simpler, easier to use and
less error-prone API.

Rarely executed fallbacks that are only executed in extremely rare OOM
situations that won't be covered by xfstests?  No thank you.  Why would you even
think that would be reasonable?

Anyway, I am getting tired of responding to all your weird arguments that don't
bring anything new to the table.  Please continue to treat your patches as
nacked and don't treat silence as agreement.  I am just tired of this.
