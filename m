How so? To be clear, at the moment there is basically just the TRNG
service we would probe for, maybe FF-A, then adding as we go. But in
any case it would be just a handful, and querying is very quick
(SMC/HVC, then just a switch/case on the other side, and ERET).
Is there any particular scenario you are concerned about? Quick
starting guests?

I think part of the idea of SMCCC is that it does NOT need firmware
advertisement, but can instead be discovered, through a safe interface.

Cheers,
Andre
