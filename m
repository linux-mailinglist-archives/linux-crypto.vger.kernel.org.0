But we're not really even living up to that expectation of dirty bytes
with acc afaict.  We're giving QEMU some initial data it can have
early, but it looks like the latest proposal hard codes dirty-bytes to
zero, so QEMU doesn't gain any insight into dirty accumulation, nor
does it know that the field is invalid.

Wouldn't it make more sense if initial-bytes started at QM_MATCH_SIZE
and dirty-bytes was always sizeof(vf_data) - QM_MATCH_SIZE?  ie. QEMU
would know that it has sizeof(vf_data) - QM_MATCH_SIZE remaining even
while it's getting ENOMSG after reading QM_MATCH_SIZE bytes of data.

That would be the ideal scenario, but again if knowing this information
once we're in STOP_COPY continues to be useful, which I infer by the
ongoing operation of this ioctl, then why don't we switch to an ioctl
that just reports bytes-remaining at that point rather than trying to
fit the square peg in the round hole to contort a STOP_COPY data
representation into initial-bytes and dirty-bytes?  If that's not
useful yet and you don't want to add dead kernel code, then let's
define that this ioctl is only available in the PRE_COPY* states and
returns -errno in the STOP_COPY state.

So let's define that this ioctl is only valid in PRE_COPY* states and
return -errno in STOP_COPY so that we have consistency between all
devices in STOP_COPY and let's also define if there's actually anything
userspace can infer about remaining STOP_COPY data size while in
PRE_COPY* via this ioctl.  For example, is dirty-bytes zero or the
remaining data structure size?

Yes, some sort of remaining-bytes is always a valid concept.  Splitting
that into initial-bytes and dirty-bytes doesn't make any sense at
STOP_COPY though.  If there's no use case for this ioctl in STOP_COPY
and the partitioning of data exposed in PRE_COPY* mode is fundamentally
specific to pre-copy support, why not disable the ioctl with the
intention to replace it with a common one specific to STOP_COPY once
there's a userspace use case?  Thanks,

Alex
