I'm still rather dubious about confusing the optimization opportunities
afforded by the ISO C standard with the diagnostic messages that both
gcc and clang can produce (and are beyond the scope of the standard).

However, let's agree to disagree on that, since it doesn't change the
outcome: it *is* useful to compare the behaviour of the two compilers.

I'm not 100% caught up on the history but I think this was the issue
that prompted -Wstringop-overflow to be disabled by default (and
includes a minimal reproducer):

What do you mean by clang is really bad at [static n]? Most of this
thread is based on the observation that clang gives *useful*
diagnostics for [static n] that are not issued for [n].

gcc certainly can generate warnings we don't get with clang, so it's
just a question of whether the false positives are enough to stop it
from being quite good!

I was curious is anything has changed in the last two years so I
compiled v6.18 allmodconfig with -Wstringop-overflow (without the
thread sanitizer which causes the known problem mentioned above
right the way up to gcc-15.2). I ran check across five architectures
(arm64, arm, riscv, s390 & x86) since we know there have been
architecture dependant differences. Not all the builds have gone
through but unless there are regressions in newer compilers then
I've only seen two -Wstringop-overflow warnings.

First is a clear false positive (of the "if something impossible
happens then something bad might happen" variety) which, happily, is
only triggered on gcc-12/aarch64 and appears to be fixed from gcc-13
onward.

Second isn't a kernel bug but it's arguably not a false positive
either. I think it could be reasonably fixed with source code changes.
See https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.18/source/net/sctp/auth.c#L645

Overall I'll look a little deeper to try and see if there are any
other ways to break -Werror builds with gcc-13 or later.
