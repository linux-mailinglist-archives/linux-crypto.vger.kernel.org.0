Alright then. Sounds like a clear case of userspace being broken. I'll
include https://git.zx2c4.com/linux-rng/commit/?id=b931eaf6ef5cef474a1171542a872a5e270e3491
or similar in my pull for 6.1, if that's okay with you. For 6.0, we're
already at rc6, so maybe better to let this one stew for a bit longer,
given the change, unless you feel strongly about having it earlier, I
guess.
