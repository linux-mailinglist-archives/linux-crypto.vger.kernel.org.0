I would argue that it only depends on syzkaller because it is currently
the only fuzzer that implements support for KFuzzTest. The communication
interface itself is agnostic.

Running the fuzzing is more of a tooling concern, and so instructions
were left out here. For the interested, the syzkaller flow is described
on GitHub: https://github.com/google/syzkaller/blob/master/docs/kfuzztest.m=
d

syzkaller doesn't use the bridge tool at all. Since a KFuzzTest target is
invoked when you write encoded data into its debugfs input file, any
fuzzer that is able to do this is able to fuzz it - this is what syzkaller
does. The bridge tool was added to provide an out-of-the-box tool
for fuzzing KFuzzTest targets with arbitrary data that doesn't depend
on syzkaller at all.

In the provided examples, the kfuzztest-bridge descriptions were
hand-written, but it's also feasible to generate them with the ELF
metadata in vmlinux. It would be easy to implement support for
this in syzkaller, but then we would depend on an external tool
for autogenerating these descriptions which we wanted to avoid.

This is exactly right. It's not used by syzkaller, but this is how it's
intended to work when it's used as a standalone tool, or for bridging
between KFuzzTest targets and an arbitrary fuzzer that doesn't
implement the required encoding logic.

I would argue that integrating with other fuzzers is feasible, but it does
require some if not a lot of work depending on the level of support. syzkal=
ler
already did most of the heavy lifting with smart input generation and mutat=
ion
for kernel functions, so the changes needed for KFuzzTest were mainly:

- Dynamically discovering targets, but you could just as easily write a
  syzkaller description for them.
- Encoding logic for the input format.

Assuming a fuzzer is able to generate C-struct inputs for a kernel function=
,
the only further requirement is being able to encode the input and write
it into the debugfs input file. The ELF data extraction is a nice-to-have
for sure, but it's not a strict requirement.

You're right that the provided examples don't leverage the feature of
being able to pass more complex nested data into the kernel. Perhaps
for a future iteration, it might be worth adding a target for a function
that takes more complex input. What do you think?

I'm not sure how much of the kernel complexity really could be reduced
if we decided to support only simpler inputs (e.g., linear buffers).
It would certainly simplify the fuzzer implementation, but the kernel
code would likely be similar if not the same.
