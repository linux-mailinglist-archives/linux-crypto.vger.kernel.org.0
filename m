Yes. I'm unsure if you're asking this because it'd be a nice
simplification to only have to open one fd, or because you're worried
about confusion. I don't think the confusion problem is one we should
take too seriously, but if you're concerned, we can always fstat and
check the maj/min. Seems a bit much, though.

Thanks for the note about poll nocancel. I'll try to add this. I don't
totally know how to manage that pluming, but I'll give it my best shot.

Yes, as mentioned, this is slower. But let's get something down first
that's *correct*, and then after we can start optimizing it. Let's not
prematurely optimize and create a problematic function that nobody
should use.

Huh, that is interesting. I guess if you're reading 4 bytes for an
integer, it winds up computing a whole chacha block each time, with half
of it doing fast key erasure and half of it being returnable to the
caller. When we later figure out a safer way to buffer, ostensibly this
will go away. But for now, we really should not prematurely optimize.

I'll have v3 out shortly with your suggested fixes.
