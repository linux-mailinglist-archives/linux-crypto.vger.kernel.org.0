Agreed. We need a new peer-to-peer authentication mechanism.
But this is storage so things move slowly and we can't remove a feature
that hundreds of millions of people depend on and break their environments
just because "need tickbox".

As an example of how long it takes to migrate to a different solution
in mass deployed storage technologies
just look at SMB1. The whole industry has been working hard and as
fast as possible to move away from
SMB1 since 2006 and we are still NOT at the stage where we can delete
this functionality.
Disable it by default for some configurations but delete? No.

Even if we get a new peer-to-peer mechanism today, it will take up to
20 years before we will be able to delete
MD4 support in the linux kernel for CIFS.   Unless we want a wildly
disruptive event where we either
break storage for hundreds of millions of people   or we force them to
remain on 5.13 for the next 20 years.

Storage is not the same as a cell-phone,  or some consumer device
where you can drop support or break them
every few years.  The timelines for migrating in storage is measured in decades.


But I guess we will have a loadable module for MD4 in cifs that both
the cifs client and the cifs server will be able to use.
Other subsystems that have hard dependency on MD4 and can not just
break their users can probably also just
use the cifs_md4 module too if they want to.
At least we can try to avoid a situation where we will have multiple
different MD4 implementations for the next decade or two in the
kernel.
