My rationale is as follows. It's beneficial to have this code to cover 
the whole spectrum of processor implementations. I for one would even 
say it's important, because penalties on processors that can't handle 
misaligned access efficiently are just too high to ignore. Now, it's 
possible to bypass it with #ifdef-s (as done for CHERI), but to make 
things less confusing, a.k.a. *less* complex, it's preferred to rely on 
the compiler predefines (as done for CHERI). Later compiler versions 
introduced apparently suitable predefines for this, 
__riscv_misaligned_slow/fast/avoid. However, as of the moment of this 
writing the macros in question don't seem to depend on the -mcpu 
parameter. But it's probably reasonable to assume that they will at a 
later point. So the suggestion would be to use these. Does it sound 
reasonable? Or would you insist on a custom macro that would need to be 
set depending on CONFIG_RISCV_EFFICIENT_UNALIGNED_ACCESS?

> - Slower on CPUs that do support efficient misaligned accesses.

With arguably marginal penalty, as discussed in the previous message. In 
the context one can also view it as a trade-off between a small penalty 
and increased #ifdef spaghetti :-)

Pallette memory extension colours fixed-size, hence accordingly aligned, 
blocks. Since the block size is larger than the word load size, any 
aligned load would be safe, because even a single "excess" or "short" 
byte would colour the whole block accordingly.

Just in case to be clear. The argument is about loads. Misaligned stores 
is naturally different matter and it would be inappropriate to handle 
them in the similar manner.

One has to recognize that it can also be a matter of cost. I mean 
imagine you want to license the least expensive IP from SiFive, or have 
very limited space for MCU. Well, Linux, naturally having higher minimum 
requirements, doesn't have to care about these, but it doesn't mean that 
nobody would :-)

Cool! The question was rather "how did it do performance-wise in the 
context of this discussion," but never mind. Thanks! In a way there is a 
contradiction. RISC-V as a concept is about openness to everybody, while 
SiFive is naturally about itself ;-)

Cheers.
