Sorry for my misunderstanding. As our testing, no gain for no-iommu 
case, because of memory copy.

It is a good idea. However, now SEC V1 and V2 are in different 
directories, more, this checking logic is quite simple.
And for our HPRE and ZIP, there is no performance or throughput problem 
as IOMMU on.
