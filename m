But that's were I got confused; one needs a private key here, but there
is no obvious candidate for it. But reading it more closely I guess the
private key is just a random number (cf the spec: g^y mod p, where y is
a random number selected by the host that shall be at least 256 bits
long). So I'll fix it up with the next round.

Thanks. Will be checking the code if I do it correctly.
