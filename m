Again, for now gen-crc-consts.py is only used for generating the structs of
constants used by the x86 pclmul code.  They are indeed all in one header file.
They all need the same declarations and attributes, and it is convenient to
generate them all at once, and name and document them in a consistent way.
Please take a closer look at the patchset (if you are interested), as it's not
entirely clear what you're attempting to comment on exactly.

gen-crc-consts.py does also have support for generating slice-by-N tables, which
it seems is what you may be attempting to comment on, but that is not currently
used for real.  It just seemed convenient to include, since it is just ~20 extra
lines in the script, and it is sufficient to reproduce any of the existing CRC
tables that are hardcoded in the kernel, and the table for any new CRC variant
that might get added in the future.  If we decide to start using that part "for
real", we could always tweak the exact formatting of the tables a bit if needed.
