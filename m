OK, so inferring the block cipher name from the skcipher algo name is
a bit finicky, since the dm-crypt code does that *after* allocating
the TFMs, and allocating the essiv skcipher happens before.
But more importantly, it appears to be allowed currently to use ESSIV
with authenticated modes, which means we'd need both a skcipher and a
aead essiv template, or do some non-trivial hacking to insert the
essiv template in the right place (which I'm not sure is even
possible)

So my main question/showstopper at the moment is: which modes do we
need to support for ESSIV? Only CBC? Any skcipher? Or both skciphers
and AEADs?
