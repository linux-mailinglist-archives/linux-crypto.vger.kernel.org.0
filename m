Apologies, I should have looked into this in more depth when you asked
me about it earlier rather than assuming it was 'obviously' the right
fix.

It's more complex than I expected given the warning, which I note
is > 0 so it's not always true.  I'm curious, which compiler generates
that warning?

So there are two ways seq_len can be set to non 0, hmac_setkey which returns a
signed int, but one that is reality is >= 0. The other is xcbc_setkey
which returns an unsigned int.

So I would suggest that in addition to what you have here, a change
to the return type of hmac_setkey in order to make it clear that
never returns a negative anyway.

Can also use if (seq_len)
rather than if (seq_len > 0)

Thanks,

Jonathan
