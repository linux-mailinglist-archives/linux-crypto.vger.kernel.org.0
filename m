Subject: [PATCH 0/4] crypto: switch to crypto API for EBOIV generation
Date:   Mon, 26 Oct 2020 15:04:43 +0200

This series creates an EBOIV template that produces a skcipher
transform which passes through all operations to the skcipher, while
using the same skcipher and key to encrypt the input IV, which is
assumed to be a sector offset, although this is not enforced.

This matches dm-crypt use of EBOIV to provide BitLocker support,
and so it is proposed as a replacement in patch #3.

Replacing the dm-crypt specific EBOIV implementation to a Crypto
API based one allows us to save a memory allocation per
each request, as well as opening the way for use of compatible
alternative transform providers, one of which, based on the
Arm TrustZone CryptoCell hardware, is proposed as patch #4.

Future potential work to allow encapsulating the handling of
multiple subsequent blocks by the Crypto API may also
benefit from this work.

The code has been tested on both x86_64 virtual machine
with the dm-crypt test suite and on an arm 32 bit board
with the CryptoCell hardware.

Since no offical source for eboiv test vectors is known,
the test vectors supplied as patch #2 are derived from
sectors which are part of the dm-crypt test suite.

Gilad Ben-Yossef (4):
  crypto: add eboiv as a crypto API template
  crypto: add eboiv(cbc(aes)) test vectors
  dm crypt: switch to EBOIV crypto API template
  crypto: ccree: re-introduce ccree eboiv support
