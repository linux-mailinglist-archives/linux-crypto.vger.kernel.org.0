See the following file for an example:

    https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/drivers/clk/sunxi-ng/ccu=
-sun50i-a64.h

I think this is definitely optional, but it makes it safer in that other
drivers would not be able to use the non-exported intermediate clocks.

What I meant was that since each clock controller hardware block has
one or many clock inputs, these should be described in the binding
as required "clocks" and "clock-names" properties.

So it's not about describing the actual relationship or clock tree,
but just having the inputs accurately described.

I think that is a question for the device tree binding maintainer, Rob.
At least for Mediatek stuff, there seem to be many separate files.

So for the apmixedsys device node, it would at least have something like:

    clocks =3D <&clkxtal>;
    clock-names =3D "xtal";

For topckgen, since it has xtal and some PLLs from apmixedsys as inputs:

    clocks =3D <&clkxtal>, <&apmixedsys CLK_ID_PLLXXX>, <&apmixedsys
CLK_ID_PLLYYY>;
    clock-names =3D "xtal", "pllXXX", "pllYYY"

The above is just an example. You should adapt it to fit your hardware
description. And the bindings should describe what is required. Note
that the clock names used here are local to this device node. They do
not need to match what the clock driver uses for the global name. So
just go with something descriptive.

The point is, cross hardware block dependencies should be clearly described
in the device tree, instead of implicitly buried in the clock drivers.

Ideally the clock driver would use the device tree to get local references
for this, but that is going to require some rework to Mediatek's common
clock code.

Having to sequence clock registration manually is likely a symptom of
inadequate clock dependency handling. So if the drivers are only using
global clock names to describe parents, what happens is that even if
the parent isn't in the system yet, the registration is allowed to
succeed. However since the parent clock isn't available yet, any
calculations involving it, such as calculating clock rates, will
yield invalid results, such as 0 clock rate.

Nope. The MT8195 team seems to be splitting things up by module, with
the device tree being its own separate module. Ideally you want to send
drivers along with the related device tree changes, so people reviewing
can get a sense of how things work. And if the hardware is publicly
available, people can actually test the changes. We can't do that if the
device tree changes aren't bundled together.
