Hello Sandy,

As Greg alluded in reply to one of these patches, memzero_explicit()
is only usually needed for stack variables, because in those cases,
the compiler is able to infer that the memset() is the last thing that
touches the variable before it goes out of scope, and so memset()ing
it can be omitted.

Variables that are passed into a function by pointer reference have a
life time that is not known to the callee, and so there is no way the
compiler can elide memset() calls, which means that using
memzero_explicit() in such cases is not needed. The exception is
functions with static linkage that may end up being inlined into their
callers, but in the crypto subsystem, many such functions are invoked
indirectly via exported function pointers, which makes inlining
impossible.
