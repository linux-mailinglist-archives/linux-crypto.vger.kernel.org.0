The generic implementation allows authentication tags of 4, 8, 12, 13, 14, 15,
or 16 bytes.  See crypto_gcm_setauthsize() in crypto/gcm.c, and see
https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-38d.pdf
section 5.2.1.2 "Output Data".  If you disagree that this is the correct
behavior, then we need to fix the generic implementation too.

Also, I just got a kernel panic in the CCP driver on boot with
CONFIG_CRYPTO_MANAGER_EXTRA_TESTS enabled.  The kernel included this patch.  So
apparently there's yet another bug that needs to be fixed.  This one must occur
infrequently enough to not be hit every time with the default
fuzz_iterations=100, but still frequently enough for me to have seen it.
