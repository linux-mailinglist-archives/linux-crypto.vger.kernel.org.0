The subject will be the commit title. I know sometimes the commit
message is trivial or redundant, but it's still a good practice to
always have one (and many maintainers will ask for one). Even if it's
only two lines :)

I see. Maybe a good way would be to provide a function taking
'struct crypto_aead' as an argument so that not every single driver
reimplement the same logic. But this can come later if needed.

:)

So in general if there's a dependency you should say so in the cover
letter.

Thanks!
