Thanks Milan.

With the XTS code removed from these drivers, the XTS template will be
used, which relies on the ECB mode helpers instead. So once we fix
those to get rid of the indirect calls, I'd expect XTS to actually
improve in performance for these algorithms.

Yes, that was my assumption. Thanks for confirming.
