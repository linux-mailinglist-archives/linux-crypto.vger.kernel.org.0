Those are some interesting ideas to make C a bit less bad!

I knew about the 'static' trick with array parameters, and I used to use
it in other projects.  It's a bit obscure, but it's in the C standard,
and both gcc and clang support the syntax.  It indeed causes clang to
start warning about too-small arrays, via -Warray-bounds which is
enabled by default.  So if we e.g. change:

    void sha256(const u8 *data, size_t len, u8 out[SHA256_DIGEST_SIZE]);

to

    void sha256(const u8 *data, size_t len, u8 out[static SHA256_DIGEST_SIZE]);

... then clang warns if a caller passes an array smaller than
SHA256_DIGEST_SIZE as 'out' (if its size is statically known).

gcc can actually warn about the too-small array regardless of 'static'.
However, gcc's warning is under -Wstringop-overflow, which we never see
because the kernel build system disables -Wstringop-overflow with gcc.

So, for now the benefit of adding 'static' would be to get warnings
about too-small arrays with one of the two supported compilers (clang).
It's too bad 'static' isn't the default behavior for array parameters in
C, but oh well...

I think it's worthwhile adding it to get better warnings, though we
should check with Linus whether he'd be okay with kernel code starting
to use this relatively obscure feature of C.

I think the 'static' trick would be better than Ard's suggestion of:

    void sha256(const u8 *data, size_t len, u8 (*out)[SHA256_DIGEST_SIZE]);

... since the "pointer to array of N elements" type would make things
difficult for callers that have any other type.  For example callers
wouldn't be able to directly use 'u8 *a', 'u8 a[M]' with size M > N, or
even a function argument 'u8 a[N]' since C implicitly converts that to
'u8 *'.  They'd need to cast it first.
