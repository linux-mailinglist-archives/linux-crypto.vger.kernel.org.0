AFAICT caam_jr_shutdown() is going to disable JR's interrupt and kill
corresponding tasklet, so I think that transform will never finish. We
probably could handle that better by walking the list of unfinished
jobs and calling their callbacks with an appropriate error code.

My thinking with get_device() and put_device() was to prevent struct
device * from being freed while we are using it. The intent with
explicit unbind was to protect against it by
device_lock()/device_unlock() as a well as check that device data is
not NULL. I think I did miss code to do that in caam_jr_free() before
accessing tfm_count.

A bit of a silly question, but is this with my patches applied or
against the vanilla driver?

Hmm, what do we do if it never does? Why do you think it would be
better than cancelling all outstanding jobs and resetting the HW?

Wouldn't it be strictly necessary if you want to wait for tfm_count
reaching zero?

Thanks,
