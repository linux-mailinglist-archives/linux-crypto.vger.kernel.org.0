This is at least the fourth or fifth time (I'm losing track) where you
have incorrectly assumed a particular non-GPL license text matches a
particular SPDX identifier without (apparently) checking.

Bagas, I urge that you learn more about the nature of SPDX identifiers
before submitting any further patches at least involving replacement
of non-GPL notices with SPDX identifiers. For this unprecedented
license notice replacement initiative to have any legitimacy it must
attempt to apply SPDX identifiers correctly.

This is not BSD-3-Clause as defined by SPDX. It may be a match to
`Brian-Gladman-3-Clause` but I haven't checked closely.

The BSD portion of this license notice is not a match to BSD-3-Clause
(see my comment on another patch which I think had the same license
text).
