Assuming you meant that to read:

  Having a way for userspace to lock pages as shared is an alternative idea; I
  just proposed the simplest solution to start the conversation.

The unmapping[*] guest private memory proposal is essentially that, a way for userspace
to "lock" the state of a page by requiring all conversions to be initiated by userspace
and by providing APIs to associate a pfn 1:1 with a KVM instance, i.e. lock a pfn to
a guest.

Andy's DMA example brings up a very good point though.  If the shared and private
variants of a given GPA are _not_ required to point at a single PFN, which is the
case in the current unmapping proposal, userspace doesn't need to do any additional
juggling to track guest conversions across multiple processes.

Any process that's accessing guest (shared!) memory simply does its locking as normal,
which as Andy pointed out, is needed for correctness today.  If the guest requests a
conversion from shared=>private without first ensuring the gfn is unused (by a host
"device"), the host will side will continue accessing the old, shared memory, which it
locked, while the guest will be doing who knows what.  And if the guest provides a GPA
that isn't mapped shared in the VMM's address space, it's conceptually no different
than if the guest provided a completely bogus GPA, which again needs to be handled today.

In other words, if done properly, differentiating private from shared shouldn't be a
heavy lift for host userspace.

[*] Actually unmapping memory may not be strictly necessary for SNP because a
    #PF(RMP) is likely just as good as a #PF(!PRESENT) when both are treated as
    fatal, but the rest of the proposal that allows KVM to understand the stage
    of a page and exit to userspace accordingly applies.
