This is a common misconception.  Actually, XTS needs 2 distinct keys to be a
CCA-secure tweakable block cipher, due to another subtle difference from XEX:
XEX (by which I really mean "XEX[E,2]") builds the sequence of masks starting
with x^1, while XTS starts with x^0.  If only 1 key is used, the inclusion of
the 0th power in XTS allows the attack described in Section 6 of the XEX paper
(https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/papers/offsets.pdf).

Of course, it's debatable what this means *in practice* to the usual XTS use
cases like disk encryption, for which CCA security may not be critical...  But
technically, single-key XTS isn't secure under as strong an attack model as XEX.
