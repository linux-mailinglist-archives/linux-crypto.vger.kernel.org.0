I don't see why it would be limited to that.

AFAIK this also means that if you make an epoll watch for
/proc/sys/kernel/random/fork_event, and then call poll() *on the epoll
fd* for some reason, that will probably already consume the event; and
if you then try to actually receive the epoll event via epoll_wait(),
it'll already be gone (because epoll tries to re-poll the "ready"
files to figure out what state those files are at now). Similarly if
you try to create an epoll watch for an FD that already has an event
pending: Installing the watch will call the ->poll handler once,
resetting the file's state, and the following epoll_wait() will call
->poll again and think the event is already gone. See the call paths
to vfs_poll() in fs/eventpoll.c.

Maybe we don't care about such exotic usage, and are willing to accept
the UAPI inconsistency and slight epoll breakage of plumbing
edge-triggered polling through APIs designed for level-triggered
polling. IDK.
