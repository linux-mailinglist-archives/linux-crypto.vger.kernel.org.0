Sure, it's not always repeatable, but that's the nature of fuzz testing.  We
*could* start with a constant seed, but then all the random numbers would change
every time anyone made any minor change to the fuzz tests anyway.

In my experience the bugs found by the fuzz tests tend to be found within a
couple hundred iterations, so are seen within a few boots at most with the
default fuzz_iterations=100, and are "always" seen with fuzz_iterations=1000.
Raising fuzz_iterations to 10000 didn't find anything else.

If you find otherwise and come across some really rare case, you should either
add a real test vector (i.e. not part of the fuzz tests) for it, or you should
update the fuzz tests to generate the case more often so that it's likely to be
hit with the default fuzz_iterations=100.  I don't think it's necessary to split
the fuzz testing into 2 parts; instead we just need to boost the probability of
generating known edge cases (e.g. see what generate_random_bytes() already does).
