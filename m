It doesn't need to be all that complex.  My plan is to add a fallback
template at the top, which could then be implemented by strategic
algorithms at the bottom through an extension of the skcipher walk
mechanism.

So you'd allocate "fscrypt(xts(aes))" instead of "xts(aes)", and
the xts-vaes code could simply use the normal skcipher walker with
zero changes.  The only changes needed in the aesni module is to
hook up the xts code to the new "fscrypt(xts(aes))" algorithm.

The real reason why I think this is the way to go is that the same
speed-up would apply everywhere.  So just as I could gain a 15%
speed-up with xts in fscrypt without any actual multibuffer code,
a similar speed-up is expected with gcm in networking.  In fact
if anything the speed-up could be greater there because the data
unit size is smaller at under 1500 bytes.

You see the Crypto API as the problem here, but for me the problem
is the legacy data unit size.  It's 2025 and there is no reason why
anyone should be dealing with units of 1500 or 4096 bytes.

Sure if you decide to go down the lib/crypto route then there is
no gain.  All it means is that you can't support hardware offload,
but neither of us really care about that.

Thanks for the pointer, I wasn't aware of its existence.  Yes
there should definitely be only one code path for this.  So
what's stopping you from removing fscrypt right now? IOW what's
missing from blk-crypto?

I'd certainly like to see that :)

Offloading a whole bio rather than a page or two is definitely
the way to go.
