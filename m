Structure-aware fuzzing is not unique to syzkaller, nor are domain
constraints for certain values.
https://github.com/google/fuzztest is one example of a fuzzer that
supports both.
libFuzzer also supports custom mutators
(https://github.com/google/fuzzing/blob/master/docs/structure-aware-fuzzing=
.md)

When designing KFuzzTest, we anticipated two potential user scenarios:
1. The code author develops the fuzz test and runs it locally to
ensure its sanity and catch obvious errors.
2. The fuzz test lands upstream and syzkaller runs it continuously.

Ethan initially developed tools for both scenarios on the syzkaller
side, prioritizing simplicity of use over the diversity of potential
non-default fuzzing engines.
However, because smoke testing does not require a syzkaller
dependency, he added the bridge utility (I believe David Gow suggested
it).
That utility is easy to use for smoke testing, as it requires only a
one-line structure description.
I understand it may not be suitable for users who want to extensively
fuzz a particular test on their own machine without involving
syzkaller.

I agree we can do a better job by implementing some of the following option=
s:
1. For tests without nested structures, or for tests that request it
explicitly, allow a simpler input format via a separate debugfs file.
2. Export the constraints/annotations via debugfs in a string format
so that fuzzers do not need vmlinux access to obtain them.
3. Export the fuzz test input structure as a string. (We've looked
into this and deemed it infeasible because test inputs may reference C
structures, and we don't have a reflection mechanism that would allow
us to dump the contents of existing structs).

Can you describe the interface between the fuzz test and the fuzzing
engine that you have in mind?
For ARCH=3Dum, if you don't need structure awareness, I think the
easiest solution would be to make FUZZ_TEST wrap the code into
something akin to LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput()
(https://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html) that would directly pass random
data into the function under test. The debugfs interface is probably
excessive in this case.

But let's say we want to run in-kernel fuzzing with e.g. AFL++ - will
a simplified debugfs interface solve the problem?
What special cases can we omit to simplify the interface?

Adding more fuzzing engines will not automatically allow us to run
this at scale.
For that, we'll need a continuous fuzzing system to manage the kernels
and corpora, report bugs, find reproducers, and bisect the causes.
I don't think building one for another fuzzing engine will be worth it.
That said, we can help developers better fuzz their code during local
runs by not always requiring the serialization format.

We are not limited to fuzzing parsers of untrusted data. The idea
behind KFuzzTest is to validate that a piece of code can cope with any
input satisfying the constraints.
We could just as well fuzz a sorting algorithm or the bitops.
E.g. Will Deacon had the idea of fuzzing a hypervisor, which
potentially has many parameters, not all of which are necessarily
blobs.

We could indeed organize the code so that simpler test cases (e.g. the
examples provided in this series) do not require the custom
serialization format.
I am still not convinced the whole serialization idea is useless, but
perhaps having a simplified version will unblock more users.

Can you please share some potential entry points you have in mind?
Understanding which functions you want to fuzz will help us simplify the fo=
rmat.

Thank you for your input!
