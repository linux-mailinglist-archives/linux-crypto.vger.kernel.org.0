Thats a good point Brijesh. I've only been testing this with SEV and
ES so haven't noticed that long setup time. I like the idea of a
module parameter to decide when to INIT, that should satisfy Sean's
concern that the user doesn't know when the INIT_EX file would be read
and that there is extra retry code (duplicated between sev_pci_init
and all the PSP commands). I'll get started on that.
