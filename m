Hi Andrew,

I have uploaded the results of my tests to my GitHub, along with all the 
binaries
containing the random bits that I collected from this Aspeed RNG using 
all 8 modes.
You can also find in this repository a patch for the hw_random core 
driver that
I've been using to collect this data. Here is the link:
   https://github.com/operezmuena/aspeed-rng-testing

You can see in the reports that when using large enough samples (40Mb in 
size)
this Aspeed RNG consistently fails the linear rank and entropy tests, no 
matter
what RNG mode is selected. However, modes 2, 4 and 6 produce better 
entropy than
the rest.
I'm now collecting rng data from 2 other AST2520 SOCs that I have in 
order to
compare results.

Regards,
Oscar
