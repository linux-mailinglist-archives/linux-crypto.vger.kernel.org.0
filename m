Yes, with that change, now it works in 5.4-rc1:

# openssl speed -evp aes-128-cbc -elapsed -engine afalg
- - - 8< - - -
The 'numbers' are in 1000s of bytes per second processed.
type             16 bytes     64 bytes    256 bytes   1024 bytes   8192 
bytes  16384 bytes
aes-128-cbc        125.63k      499.39k     1858.18k     6377.00k 
25753.93k    31167.08k

I also quickly tried nginx https, that seems to transfer a file correctly.
And a bit faster, but not by this much, I have to look into that further.
For now I assume the kernel part seems to be working fine.

Thanks, much appreciated!
Gert
