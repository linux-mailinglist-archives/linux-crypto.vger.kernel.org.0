The one that triggered this was ecdh-nist-p256-generic, which
calls into drbg.  Both ecdh and drbg are at level subsys_initcall
so the order between them is random.

Beyond this, obviously we have already moved many algorithms
ot subsys_initcall precisely for this purpose and with this
patch, they can all be moved back to module_init.

Sure, I can rename that.

It's certainly possible to optimise this, but I'm not inclined
to do it unless someone can show me that it's a real issue :)

The simplest way to optimise this would be to create a separate
list for the test larvae.

Sure.

The patch is supposed to deal with that scenario by starting the
test on-demand should someone request for it before late_initcall.
