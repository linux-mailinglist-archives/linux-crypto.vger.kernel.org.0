FWIW, the kernel currently still has a bunch of places that use
C89-style length-1 arrays (which were in the past used to work around
C89's lack of proper flexible arrays). Gustavo A. R. Silva has a bunch
of patches pending to change those places now, but those are not
marked for stable backporting; so in all currently released kernels,
we'll probably keep having length-1 arrays at the ends of C structs
that are used as if they were flexible arrays. (Unless someone makes
the case that these patches are not just cleanups but actually fix
some sort of real bug, and therefore need to be backported.)

The code in this example looks just like one of those C89-style
length-1 arrays to me (except that the length isn't 1).

Of course I do agree that this should be cleaned up, and that having
bogus array lengths in the source code is a bad idea.

I guess that kinda leads to the question: Do we just need to fix the
kernel code here (which is comparatively easy), or do you think that
this is a sufficiently big problem that we need to go and somehow
change the actual UAPI headers here (e.g. by deprecating the existing
UAPI struct and making a new one with a different name)?
