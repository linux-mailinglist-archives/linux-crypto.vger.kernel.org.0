My name is David Lee and i am  from United Kingdom,I was browsing and I saw your email, So i decided to write you if you a letter if only your profile is real, I have been diagnosed with esophageal cancer. It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a few months to live. I am very rich, but was never generous; I have given most of my assets to my immediate family members.

I have decided to give alms to charity organizations. I cannot do this myself anymore because of my health. I once asked members of my family to give some money to charity organizations, they refused and kept the money. I have a huge cash deposit of Eighteen Million dollars with RASCO PRIVATE AGENCY DELIVERY. I will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatch it to charity organizations. You will take out 20% of these funds for your assistance

I will like you to get back to me as soon as possible and treats with absolute confidentiality and sincerity


Thank you
David Lee
