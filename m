Ah I see, you mean something like having 3+ providers of "algXY",
 - algXY_driver0, ->cra_priority =3D 100
 - algXY_driver1, ->cra_priority =3D 200
 - algXY_driver1, ->cra_priority =3D 300
where the latter needs a different "algXY" as a fallback?

Hmm yes, I haven't thought of this and my patch here would indeed break
it.

In order to keep a FIPS certification manageable in terms of scope,
we're looking for a way to disable everything under drivers/crypto iff
fips_enabled =3D=3D 1. The most convenient way to achieve this downstream
would be to add dummy entries to testmgr.c like so:

static int alg_test_nop(const struct alg_test_desc *desc, const char *drive=
r,
			u32 type, u32 mask)
{
	/* Succeed in non-FIPS mode. */
	return 0;
}

static const struct alg_test_desc alg_test_descs[] =3D {
	...,
	{
		.alg =3D "sha256-padlock-nano",
		.test =3D alg_test_nop,
		.fips_allowed =3D 0,
	},
        ...
};

The concern is about e.g the following sequence of events during boot:
- "sha256-padlock-nano" gets registered, the test gets scheduled.
- An unrelated modprobe is getting invoked. The signature verification
  code, e.g pkcs7_digest(), requests "sha256", finds the pending
  "sha256-padlock-nano" testing larval and puts itself in a wait for it.
- The scheduled "sha256-padlock-nano" test gets to run and, as per
  ->fips_allowed =3D=3D 0, is forced to fail with -EINVAL.
- pkcs7_digest() wakes up and fails with -EAGAIN due to the "failed"
  testing larval.
- The unrelated modprobe fails even though sha256-generic would
  have been available all the time.

FWIW, I picked sha256-padlock-nano and modprobe at random for the sake
of providing an example here -- I haven't checked in detail, but I guess
that e.g. the combination of dm-crypt + a number of different FIPS
approved algorithms could be similarly susceptible, too.

So to recap, my initial approach for working around the above was to
make crypto_alg_lookup() to skip over testing larvals in an additional,
first search. As you said, this would break the "fallback" scenario
though.

As an alternative, how about not doing the additional search for
non-larvals upfront, but only as a resort in case crypto_larval_wait()
returned failure instead?

But granted, the scenario above is not an issue at all for upstream with
a pristine testmgr.c and it would be quite relatable if you wouldn't
like to get bothered with any of this. I'm only bringing it up because
others might perhaps come across this as well...


Thanks!

Nicolai
