If the guest and host share a random key, then they also share the key handle.
And that handle+key would also need to be shared across all guests.  I doubt this
option is acceptable on the security front.

Using multiple random keys is a non-starter because they can't be restored via
LOADIWKEY.

Using multiple software-defined keys will have moderate overhead because of the
possibility of using KL from soft IRQ context, i.e. KVM would have to do
LOADIWKEY on every VM-Enter _and_ VM-Exit.  It sounds like LOADIWKEY has latency
similar to WRMSR, so it's not a deal-breaker, but the added latency on top of the
restrictions on how the host can use KL certainly lessen the appeal.

Migrating is sketchy because the IWKEY has to be exposed to host userspace.
But, I think the migration aspect is a secondary discussion.

This is essentially a variant of (b).  In both cases, the host has full control
over the guest's key.

Deferring KL usage to post-boot can work, but KVM shouldn't be allowed to expose
KL to a guest until KL has been explicitly configured in the host.  If KVM can
spawn KL guests before the host is configured, the sysfs knob would have to deal
with the case where the desired configuration is incompatible with exposing KL
to a guest.

What would be the motivation for this mode?  It largely defeats the value
proposition of KL, no?

AFAIK, there's no way for the guest to verify that it got a truly random key.
Hell, the guest can't even easily verify that KL is even supported.  The host
can lie about CPUID and CR4.KL, and intercept all KL instructions via #UD by
running the guest with CR4.KL=0.

I also don't see any reason to define a paravirt interface for a truly random
key.  Using a random key all but requires a single guest to have exclusive access
to KL, and in that case the host can simply expose KL to only that guest.

I really want to use see concrete guest use cases before we start adding paravirt
interfaces.
