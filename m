The core issue is that on some kernels/architectures, reading from
/dev/urandom can degrade to GRND_INSECURE (approximately), and while the
result is likely still unpredictable, not everyone would label that as a
CSPRNG.

If we document arc4random as a CSPRNG, this means that we would have to
ditch the fallback code and abort the process if the getrandom system
call is not available: when reading from /dev/urandom as a fallback, we
have no way of knowing if we are in any of the impacted execution
environments.  Based on your other comments, it seems that you are
interested in such fallbacks, too, but I don't think you can actually
have both (CSPRNG + fallback).

And then there is the certification issue.  We really want applications
that already use OpenSSL for other cryptography to use RAND_bytes
instead of arc4random.  Likewise for GNUTLS and gnutls_rnd.  What should
authors of those cryptographic libraries?  That's less clear, and really
depends on the constraints they operate in (e.g., they may target only a
subset of architectures and kernel versions).

Thanks,
Florian
