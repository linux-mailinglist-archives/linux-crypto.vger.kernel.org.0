Yes, that's correct.  The optimized code gets enabled by a
subsys_initcall.

Seems plausible, since it looks like during early boot there is just one
call to each of aesgcm_expandkey(), aesgcm_encrypt(), and
aesgcm_decrypt().  Specifically during snp_secure_tsc_prepare().  Any
other AES-GCM operations happen later as calls from
drivers/virt/coco/sev-guest/sev-guest.c, which does not run that early.

A malicious VMM being able to inject interrupts arbitrarily is a bit
scary, though.
