The only thing I could say is that the kernel side has optimized
inplace decompression compared to fuse so that it will reuse the
same buffer for decompression but with a safe margin (according to
the current lz4 decompression implementation).  It shouldn't behave
different just due to different CPUs.  Let me find more clues
later, also maybe we should introduce a way for users to turn off
this if needed.
