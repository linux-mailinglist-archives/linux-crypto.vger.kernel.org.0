No, certainly not, and I think this sort of thought belies a really
backwards attitude. Hardware RNGs are assumed to produce good
randomness. Some manufacturers provide a caveat, "actually, we're giving
raw entropy with only N bits quality", but for the ones who don't, the
overarching assumption is that the bits are fully entropic. This is
what's done every place else in the field, across operating systems,
boot environments, firmwares, and otherwise. It's so much so, that both
EDK2's EFI and U-Boot's DTB and U-Boot's EFI will use RNGs for which the
Linux driver has an empty quality setting and provide output from these
as fully entropic seeds to Linux. And why shouldn't they? It seems
entirely reasonable to do, given very okay assumptions.

But more generally, this fetishization of entropy estimation has got to
come to a close at some point. It wasn't a very good idea in the first
place to bake that into the heart of all the Linux RNG APIs, but here we
are. Just consider how meaningless the count is: random.c will do some
completely bogus hocus pocus with interrupt counting, with disk seeks,
with input events, to draw a number out of hat. Or it will twiddle
around with `struct timer_list` functions and count some entropy there,
which is complete nonsense, but whatever, it's by and large "good
enough". However, what we're talking about here are RNG hardware devices
that say on the tin "hey I'm an RNG device", which is an infinitely
better guarantee that we should count entropy from them (unless, of
course, the tin also says, "only count half the bits", or whatever). 

I mention "good enough", because really, the more important thing here
from the security angle is that we're getting bits into the RNG quite
fast at boot, and we largely accomplish that now. The next important
thing is getting the RNG initialized quickly so that userspace doesn't
block. Adding hw_random to the equation makes perfect sense here.

And, like RDRAND, there's still a switch to turn this off for lunatics
who simply don't trust anything.

So, no, the way hw_random is oriented now, the whole thing is backwards,
in a way that's not reflected across the rest of the hardware RNG and OS
ecosystem, and just results in a total waste. I think it's important
that we don't hold up progress here.
