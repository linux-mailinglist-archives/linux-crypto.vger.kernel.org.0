It's not the 90s anymore.  Crypto is fast now, and used ubiquitously.

And "crypto" doesn't necessarily mean a large operation.  It can be hashing just
a few bytes of data, for example.

Also as you know, the crypto API includes some non-cryptographic algorithms too.

BTW, x86 does allow SIMD in hardirq context in some cases.

Certainly agreed that crypto in hardirqs is something to be avoided in general,
though.

So maybe your proposal is okay, if it's done properly.

The thing I actually have more of a problem with is that you tend to start
making random API changes without any of the necessary prerequisites like
updating documentation, or adding debug assertions to catch violations of new
requirements.  You've already started removing the fallbacks from shash (commit
3846c01d42526bc31), but neither of those things have been done.  So we're
currently in a weird state where the shash API is explicitly documented to work
in all contexts, but you've broken that.
