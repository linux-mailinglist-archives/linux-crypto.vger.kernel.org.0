I need a little guidance on how to proceed with this. Should I have
the new module parameter 'psp_init_on_probe' just disable PSP init on
module init if false. Or should it also disable PSP init during
command flow if it's true?

I was thinking I should just have 'psp_init_on_probe' default to true,
and if false it stops the PSP init during sev_pci_init(). If I add the
second change that seems like it changes the ABI. Thoughts?
