Thanks, Ethan. I've had a bit of a play around with the
kfuzztest-bridge tool, and it seems to work pretty well here. I'm
definitely looking forward to trying out

The only real feature I'd find useful would be to have a
human-readable way of describing the data (as well as the structure),
which could be useful when passing around reproducers, and could make
it possible to hand-craft or adapt cases to work cross-architecture,
if that's a future goal. But I don't think that it's worth holding up
an initial version for.

On the subject of architecture support, I don't see anything
particularly x86_64-specific in here (or at least, nothing that
couldn't be relatively easily fixed). While I don't think you need to
support lots of architectures immediately, it'd be nice to use
architecture-independant things (like the shared
include/asm-generic/vmlinux.lds.h) where possible. And even if you're
focusing on x86_64, supporting UML -- which is still x86
under-the-hood, but has its own linker scripts -- would be a nice
bonus if it's easy. Other things, like supporting 32-bit or big-endian
setups are nice-to-have, but definitely not worth spending too much
time on immediately (though if we start using some of the
formats/features here for KUnit, we'll want to support them).

Finally, while I like the samples and documentation, I think it'd be
nice to include a working example of using kfuzztest-bridge alongside
the samples, even if it's something as simple as including a line
like:
./kfuzztest-bridge "some_buffer { ptr[buf] len[buf, u64]}; buf {
arr[u8, 128] };"  "test_underflow_on_buffer" /dev/urandom

Regardless, this is very neat, and I can't wait (with some
apprehension) to see what it finds!

Cheers,
-- David
