Subject: [PATCH 0/2] crypto: qce driver fixes for gcm
Date:   Mon,  3 Feb 2020 16:03:17 -0300

I've finally managed to get gcm(aes) working with the qce crypto engine.

These first patch fixes a bug where the gcm authentication tag was being
overwritten during gcm decryption, because it was passed in the same sgl
buffer as the crypto payload.  The qce driver appends some private state
buffer to the request destination sgl, but it was not checking the
length of the sgl being passed.

The second patch works around a problem, which I frankly can't pinpoint
what exactly is the cause, but after some help from Ard Biesheuvel, I
think it is related to DMA.  When gcm sends a request in
crypto_gcm_setkey, it stores the hash (the crypto payload) and the iv in
the same data struct.  When the drivers updates the IV, then the payload
gets overwritten with the unencrypted data, or all zeroes, it may be a
coincidence.

However, it works if I pass the request down to the fallback driver--it
is used by the driver to accept 192-bit-key requests.  All I had to do
was setup the fallback regardless of key size, and then check the
payload length along with the keysize to pass the request to the
fallback.  This turns out to enhance performance, because of the
avoided latency that comes with using the hardware.

I've started with checking for a single 16-byte AES block, and that is
enough to make gcm work.  Next thing I've done was to tune the request
size for performance.  What got me started into looking at the qce
driver was reports of it being detrimental to VPN speed, by the way.
I've tested this win an Asus RT-AC58U, but the slow VPN reports[1] have
more devices affected.  Access to the device was kindly provided by
@simsasss.

I've used the openssl speed util to measure the speed, with an AF_ALG
engine I've written to make use of the kernel driver from userspace[2],
running on 4.19.78--I can't run this on a newer kernel yet.

TLDR: In the worst (where the hardware is slowest) case, hardware and
software speed match at aroung 768 bytes, but I lowered the threshold to
512 to benefit the CPU offload.

Here's the script I've used:
#!/bin/sh
for len in 256 512 768 1024; do
  echo Block-size: ${len} bytes
  for key in 128 256; do
    for mode in cbc ctr ecb; do
      rmmod qcrypto
      openssl speed -elapsed -evp aes-${key}-${mode} -engine afalg \
                -bytes ${len} 2>&1 \
        | grep ^aes \
        | sed "s/aes-${key}-${mode}     /aes-${key}-${mode} soft/"
      insmod /tmp/qcrypto.ko
      openssl speed -elapsed -evp aes-${key}-${mode} -engine afalg \
                -bytes ${len} 2>&1 \
        | grep ^aes \
        | sed "s/aes-${key}-${mode}     /aes-${key}-${mode} qce /"
    done
  done
done

Here's a sample run--numbers vary from run to run, sometimes greatly:

I imagine that if I were to run the benchmark within the kernel, the
resulting threshould would be eve higher, since there's a pretty much
fixed latency from the context switches.  Nonetheless, I think it's
better to let the engine run more, to offload the CPU.

Cheers,

Eneas
