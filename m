Thank you for the detailed explanation Ard. This makes sense to me.

I did a quick lookup for hardware crypto accelerators available on the 
market and, indeed, symmetric algorithms along with hashes constitute 
the vast majority of what these accelerators support [0].

I've found some accelerators that support asymmetric operations but it 
seems they are mostly targeted at microcontrollers and as such are 
probably outside of supported area here [1][2]. (The accelerator at [0] 
supports asymmetric operations but only public key ones).
