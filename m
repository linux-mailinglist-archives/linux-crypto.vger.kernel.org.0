There's only one default implementation of crc32c, not multiple, and it has
priority 100.  All other crc32c implementations have priority > 100.  So yes,
you can check the priority (which would require adding a function to
lib/libcrc32c.c to get it).  Alternatively you could check whether the driver
name is "crc32c-generic" or not.
