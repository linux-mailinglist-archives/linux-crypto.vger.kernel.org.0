Are you sure?  I don't see anything that had no test vectors but didn't use
alg_test_null.

I suggest at least downgrading it to KERN_INFO, since that's the level used for
logging that there wasn't any test description found at all:

	printk(KERN_INFO "alg: No test for %s (%s)\n", alg, driver);

The only actual issue is that you can't reuse the __VECS() macro because it adds
an extra level of braces, right?

Okay, I guess that makes sense.  It wasn't obvious to me though.
