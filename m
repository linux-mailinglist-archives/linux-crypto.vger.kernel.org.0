Have you by chance been looking at performance of 64 bit crc algorithms,
or have any recommendations there?

I've been starting to consider switching to a 64 bit crc for the
default for bcachefs - and we do want it to be a regular crc so we can
combine/add them together, not one of the newer fancier add/xor based
hashes.

I thought we'd gotten a faster PCLMULQDQ based implementation of a
crc64, but looking again it appears not, hrm.
