I was surprised too!  For most of its development, this set had an interface to
get the number of cores on the theory that this was about where the bandwidth
got saturated, but the data showed otherwise.

There were diminishing returns, but they were more apparent on Haswell than
Skylake for instance.  I'll post some more data later in the thread where you
guys are talking about it.

Agreed.  I'll rope in some of the arch lists in the next version and include
the debugging knob to vary the thread count.

This guarantee holds now with the max-order alignment passed to padata, so I
don't see what more doing it on section boundaries buys us.
