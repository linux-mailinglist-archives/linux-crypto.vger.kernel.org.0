I'm not too familiar with the history of lib/crypto/, but I have noticed 
over the past months that there has been a noticeable shift to moving 
in-kernel users from the kernel crypto API to the library APIs. While 
this seems to be an overall improvement, it does make FIPS compliance 
more challenging. If the kernel crypto API is the only user of 
lib/crypto/, it is possible to make an argument that the testmgr.c 
self-tests cover the lib/crypto/ implementations (since those would be 
called at some point). However since other code is now calling 
lib/crypto/ directly, that assumption may no longer hold.

Currently I don't see how direct users of the lib/crypto/ APIs can be 
FIPS compliant; self-tests are only one of the requirements that are not 
implemented. It would be one of the more straightforward requirements to 
implement though, if this is something the kernel project would accept 
at that (lib/crypto/) layer.

Kind regards,
Joachim
