> +Power9 processor introduced Virtual Accelerator Switchboard (VAS) which
> +allows both userspace and kernel communicate to co-processor
> +(hardware accelerator) referred to as the Nest Accelerator (NX). The NX
> +unit comprises of one or more hardware engines or co-processor types
> +such as 842 compression, GZIP compression and encryption. On power9,
> +userspace applications will have access to only GZIP Compression engine
> +which supports ZLIB and GZIP compression algorithms in the hardware.
> +
> +To communicate with NX, kernel has to establish a channel or window and
> +then requests can be submitted directly without kernel involvement.
> +Requests to the GZIP engine must be formatted as a co-processor Request
> +Block (CRB) and these CRBs must be submitted to the NX using COPY/PASTE
> +instructions to paste the CRB to hardware address that is associated with
> +the engine's request queue.
> +
> +The GZIP engine provides two priority levels of requests: Normal and
> +High. Only Normal requests are supported from userspace right now.
> +
> +This document explains userspace API that is used to interact with
> +kernel to setup channel / window which can be used to send compression
> +requests directly to NX accelerator.
> +
> +
> +Overview
> +========
> +
> +Application access to the GZIP engine is provided through
> +/dev/crypto/nx-gzip device node implemented by the VAS/NX device driver.
> +An application must open the /dev/crypto/nx-gzip device to obtain a file
> +descriptor (fd). Then should issue VAS_TX_WIN_OPEN ioctl with this fd to
> +establish connection to the engine. It means send window is opened on GZIP
> +engine for this process. Once a connection is established, the application
> +should use the mmap() system call to map the hardware address of engine's
> +request queue into the application's virtual address space.
> +
> +The application can then submit one or more requests to the the engine by
> +using copy/paste instructions and pasting the CRBs to the virtual address
> +(aka paste_address) returned by mmap(). User space can close the
> +established connection or send window by closing the file descriptior
> +(close(fd)) or upon the process exit.
> +
> +Note that applications can send several requests with the same window or
> +can establish multiple windows, but one window for each file descriptor.
> +
> +Following sections provide additional details and references about the
> +individual steps.

> +NX-GZIP Device Node
> +===================
> +
> +There is one /dev/crypto/nx-gzip node in the system and it provides
> +access to all GZIP engines in the system. The only valid operations on
> +/dev/crypto/nx-gzip are:
> +
> +	* open() the device for read and write.
> +	* issue VAS_TX_WIN_OPEN ioctl
> +	* mmap() the engine's request queue into application's virtual
> +	  address space (i.e. get a paste_address for the co-processor
> +	  engine).
> +	* close the device node.
> +
> +Other file operations on this device node are undefined.
> +
> +Note that the copy and paste operations go directly to the hardware and
> +do not go through this device. Refer COPY/PASTE document for more
> +details.
> +
> +Although a system may have several instances of the NX co-processor
> +engines (typically, one per P9 chip) there is just one
> +/dev/crypto/nx-gzip device node in the system. When the nx-gzip device
> +node is opened, Kernel opens send window on a suitable instance of NX
> +accelerator. It finds CPU on which the user process is executing and
> +determine the NX instance for the corresponding chip on which this CPU
> +belongs.

You have 'codes and restrictions' twice here.

Patch 3 seems to allow a 64k page if the system is compiled for 64k
pages... Should it restrict it to 4K?

In which RFC?

Where would someone find the NX workbook?
