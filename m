I had this driver running on another non-Marvell SoC with very minor
modifications, so there's then at least one hardware which is similar
enough. In this case I don't see why this should be named "Marvell".

What are the features specific to those Marvell SoC that won't be used
in other integrations? I'm pretty sure there are common features between
all those EIP97 engines on different SoCs.

We don't know when/in what shape those patches will be merged, so in
the meantime please make the "no firmware" the default choice.

I agree having non-written rules is not good (I don't make them), but
not everything is described in the documentation or in the coding style.
I don't really care about the comment style when adding new ones, but
those are valid (& recommended) in crypto/ and it just make the patch
bigger.

OK, I won't debate this for hours. At least add a comment, for when
*others* will add support for new hardware (because that really is the
point, *others* might update and modify the driver).

But it's not done yet and we might discuss how you'll handle this. You
can't know for sure you'll end up with a different approach.

At least remove this in a separate patch.

I don't know if this is a written rule (as many others), but you'll find
plenty of examples of reviews asking not to have extra parenthesis.

So that's really the point here :) This variable was introduced to
convey the engine information, not the way it is integrated. There are
EIP97 engines not on Marvell SoC which will just work out of the box (or
with let's say a one liner adding support for using a clock). And the
version could be in both cases something like 'EIP97'.

Well, you have more info about this than I do, I can only trust you on
this (it's just weird based on the experience I described just before,
it seems to me the differences are not that big, but again, you know the
h/w better).

I just don't want to end up with:

  if (version == EIP97_MRVL || version == EIP97_XXX || ...)

OK, I do think this would be a good solution :)
