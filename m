Right. I didn't even notice that you were keeping interrupts disabled
the whole time when using the h/w block. That means that any serious
use of this h/w block will make IRQ latency go through the roof.

I recommend that you go back to the drawing board on this driver,
rather than papering over the issues with a spin_trylock(). Perhaps it
would be better to model it as a ahash (even though the h/w block
itself is synchronous) and use a kthread to feed in the data.
