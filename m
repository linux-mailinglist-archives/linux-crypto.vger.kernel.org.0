So that's something that will probably happen once the kernel is built 
using APX anyway?

So:

> +	if (!irqs_disabled())

So why is the irqs_disabled() check needed here? (On x86 it can be a 
bit expensive at times, because the IRQ flag has to be loaded, 
including all flags, so basically it's a soft synchronization point of 
a sort.)

Ie. why cannot we simply do a local_bh_disable()/enable() pair (on 
!RT), ie. fpregs_lock()/fpregs_unlock()?

local_bh_disable() is very similar in cost to preempt_disable(), both 
are increasing the preempt_count.

Thanks,
