It becomes even more complicated to reason about if you take into
account that you may have 10s or 100s of instances of the CPU crypto
logic (one for each CPU) while the number of h/w IP blocks and/or
parallel processing queues typically doesn't scale in the same way.

But we are going down a rabbit hole here: even if you and I would
agree that it never makes any sense whatsoever to use h/w accelerators
from userland, the reality is that this is happening today, and so we
have to ensure that all drivers expose an interface that produces the
correct result for all imaginable corner cases.

Evidently, it requires some care to use the AF_ALG interface
meaningfully. But that does not mean it cannot ever be used in the
right way.
