Please correct me if I'm wrong, but are the lib/crypto/ APIs not 
exported for everyone to use? Even if the entire kernel is the FIPS 
module, wouldn't that mean the APIs could be used by e.g. dynamically 
loaded kernel modules?

You are right there are some nuances about the HMAC key lengths, as with 
most FIPS requirements. There's other FIPS requirements, like tag sizes 
for HMAC, or IV generation for AES-GCM encryption, that also have very 
similar nuances.

I'm more trying to figure out a general approach to address these kinds 
of requirements. What I usually see in FIPS modules, is that the FIPS 
module API is as conservative as possible, rather than relying on the 
callers to perform the FIPS requirement checks.
