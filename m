IMHO that is where the flexibility of the LRNG comes in. I am currently in 
discussion with the German BSI on their requirements and these requirements 
can be covered by a few extra lines since it only affects a different initial 
seeding of the DRNG.

In any case, the LRNG supports other approaches by:

- select one or more entropy sources (or provide one from external) that are 
considered appropriate

- if needed, adjust the initial seeding operation

- if needed, adjust the crypto primitives that are in use.
