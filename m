I assume you're not trying to pull the discussion off-topic. The one and
only choice here is that some people believe in NIST and certifications.
Yes, others don't, no problem either. The former folks boot with fips=1,
that's it. Those people are usually certain about their decision.

That option is about to break, for reasons I stated previously. This patch
set is to introduce the now-missing pieces. One thing worth to discuss here
would be whether people not so security conscious should benefit from the
sanity checks as well. IMHO they should, because, as Willy explained, stick
with the option that's always valid.

My disappointment was that _none_ of the maintaners had an on-topic,
technical remark. I get the impression some read "FIPS" and stop, regardless
of the actual functionality.
