OK. Can you share your git tree again? I will try to ping some people.

Yes, but 'are not known' today is not enough. Once we open that door,
it becomes our responsibility as kernel maintainers to ensure that
this remains the case.

So i understand perfectly well that current in-kernel users may never
issue crypto requests that exercise this code path. But the nice thing
today is that we don't have to care about this at all, since zero
length vectors are simply supported as well. Once we start
distinguishing the two, we have to start policing this at *some* level
rather than just pretend the issue isn't there and get bitten by it
down the road.

So no, i am not missing your point. But I think we disagree on your
conclusion that this permits is to optimize this case away and simply
don't reason about it at all.

I see.

So which algorithms that IPsec actually uses on your hardware does
this issue apply to? Does the hardware implement the complete AEAD
transform? Or does it rely on software to wire the MAC and skcipher
pieces together?

The Latin term escapes me, but surely, complaining about the other's
unwillingness to compromise rather than give actual convincing
arguments is one of the well known rhetorical fallacies? :-)
