You have got it completely backwards:

CTS has never worked in any kernel implementation, so regardless of
what the spec says, supporting it in the kernel is not a high priority
issue whichever way you put it. Now is the first time anyone has asked
for it in 12 years, and only because someone spotted a deviation
between a h/w and a s/w implementation, not because anyone tried to
use it and failed. (Note that passing anything other than a multiple
of the block size will cause an error rather than fail silently)

Truncated IVs are a huge issue, since we already expose the correct
API via AF_ALG (without any restrictions on how many of the IV bits
are populated), and apparently, if your AF_ALG request for xts(aes)
happens to be fulfilled by the CAAM driver and your implementation
uses more than 64 bits for the IV, the top bits get truncated silently
and your data might get eaten.

In my experience, users tend to care more about the latter than the former.
