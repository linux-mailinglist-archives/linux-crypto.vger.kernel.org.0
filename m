Precisely.

I think the description may be updated by simply refer to IV[j-1]. Then you 
would not have a stateful operation, but you rest on the IV of the previous 
operation.

The state of all block chaining modes we currently have is defined with the 
IV. That is the reason why I mentioned it can be implemented stateless when I 
am able to get the IV output from the previous operation.

Agreed, but all I need is the IV from the previous round without relying on 
any state.

I will relay that comment back to the authors for update.
