Applied first patch only to arm64 (for-next/crypto), thanks!

[1/9] arm64: assembler: add cond_yield macro
      https://git.kernel.org/arm64/c/d13c613f136c

This is the only patch on the branch, so I'm happy for it to be pulled
into the crypto tree too if it enables some of the other patches to land
in 5.12.

Cheers,
