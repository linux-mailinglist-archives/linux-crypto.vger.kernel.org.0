I can speak for my distro.
We have not proposed them because they are hacks, we know they are
hacks, and we know they are not the long term solution.
Yet we have no better way (in our products, today) so far to deal with
these issues because what is needed is an effort like LRNG (does not
have to be this specific implementation), because hacks will not cut it
in the long term.

Greg,
I think you can takes Stephan's introduction and supporting material
from this patchset to see what are the requirements. These patches have
not been maturing in a void, but Stephan basically distilled
discussions between multiple vendors as well as regulatory bodies (as
you can see he has reviews from BSI and NIST requirements are also
fully represented here).

He addressed a few aspects I can mention but are not the only ones:
performance (esp on NUMA systems), not blocking at boot due to lack of
entropy, NIST/BSI conformance, flexibility so that future regulatory
requirements can be easily integrated and upstreamed.

Please let me know in what format you want to see these requirements,
and I will work with other to provide them.

Simo.
