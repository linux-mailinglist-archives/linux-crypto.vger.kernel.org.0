Remember that the Zinc patchset was very vocal about not relying on
the Linux crypto API, yet it [ab]used the crypto blkcipher_walk API
(which was already deprecated at that point) in a rather horrid way,
by going around the blkcipher API itself, and creating some mock
objects that the blkcipher scatterlist walker would expect to exist.

So instead, I opted to rewrite this code using the SG miter API so that:
- src == dst, and so we only need to traverse (and kmap) a single
scatterlist instead of two in parallel (as Wireguard has no need for
the latter)
- no elaborate handling of the scatterlist elements when they are not
a multiple of the cipher chunk size (which is not needed for a stream
cipher liker ChaCha)
- no need to use scatterwalk_map_and_copy() (and do another kmap()) to
access the tag if it was covered by the last scatterlist element.

No, the problem with using kmap_atomic() is that it disables
preemption even on !HIGHMEM architectures. So using it unconditionally
here means that all chacha/poly processing will execute with
preemption disabled on 64-bit architectures as well.

This means that, even if you avoid the SIMD accelerated ciphers for
latency reasons (as they disable preemption as well), you are still
running the bulk of the WireGuard processing with preemption disabled.

AIUI, the common case is that the entire packet is covered by a single
scatterlist element, so there is no room for latency reduction here.

The problem is really that kmap_atomic() is not simply a no-op on
!HIGHMEM architectures. If we can fix that, I have no objections to
this patch.
