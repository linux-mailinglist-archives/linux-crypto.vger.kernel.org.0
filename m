As Herbert said, the ctx parameters could be made 'void *'.

And I also asked whether indirect calls to asm code are even allowed with CFI.
IIRC, the AOSP kernels have been patched to remove them from arm64.  It would be
helpful if you would answer that question, since it would inform the best
approach here.

As for the "ecb" functions taking 'u8 *' but the "cbc" ones taking 'u128 *' and
the same function being used in the blocks==1 case, you could just pick one of
the types to use for both.  'u8 *' probably makes more sense since both ecb and
cbc operate on blocks of 16 bytes but don't interpret them as 128-bit integers.
