Thank you for the detailed reply and for pointing me to the existing
ML-KEM/X-Wing patchset. I spent some time reviewing the implementation
to better understand the design choices and how they compare to the
approach I took in my own work.

After reviewing the patchset, I can see several strengths in the
implementation. It integrates cleanly into the existing lib/crypto
infrastructure, reuses kernel cryptographic primitives, avoids large
stack allocations, and includes KUnit-based validation. The
implementation also appears intentionally compact and well aligned
with existing kernel conventions.

While reviewing the implementation, I noticed that decapsulation
allocates a temporary workspace for each operation. This is one of the
areas where my design diverged, which is what originally motivated the
reusable pool approach.

My implementation was developed with a somewhat different goal in
mind. I experimented with a reusable decapsulation workspace model
where memory is allocated during key initialization and then reused
across subsequent decapsulation operations. The main motivation was
reducing allocation frequency and minimizing both stack usage and
repeated memory management during decapsulation.

As a result, the implementation avoids allocations during
decapsulation entirely by reusing preallocated workspaces associated
with the key context. My original hypothesis was that moving memory
allocation to key initialization, thereby eliminating allocations from
the decapsulation path, could reduce allocation overhead during
repeated decapsulation operations and be beneficial in environments
where allocation activity is considered undesirable.

Another difference is the integration level. My prototype explored
direct integration through the KPP interface, whereas the patchset
focuses on providing a reusable cryptographic library component within
lib/crypto. These approaches address somewhat different layers of the
kernel crypto stack.

The primary reason I initially started working on this implementation
was to explore whether a reusable-workspace architecture could be
useful in environments where allocation frequency and memory reuse are
considered important design factors. I therefore wanted to understand
whether such an approach might offer any practical value within the
kernel context, even if the overall implementation strategy differs
from the existing patchset.

The goal is to analyze the results and understand whether the
reusable-workspace approach actually achieves its intended goals in
terms of memory usage, allocation behavior, throughput, and related
metrics. In particular, I am interested in understanding whether such
an approach may provide practical benefits in environments where stack
space is constrained or where reducing allocation activity is
desirable. To better evaluate these tradeoffs, I am currently
preparing a comparison against several established ML-KEM
implementations. If such data would be useful for the discussion, I
would be happy to share the results once they are available.

Best regards,
K. Zavertailo
