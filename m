I've now unified the code paths for single-block and multi-block processing in
fsverity and dm-verity, which I think addresses your remaining concern that's
feasible to address.  Your feedback has been conflating different issues, and it
only comes in once every few weeks, so it's a bit hard to follow.  But I think
the remaining thing that you're asking for is to make the API to be part of
"ahash" and use the existing async completion callback.  That's not actually
feasible, for the reasons that I've explained in detail.  See in particular
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-crypto/20240503152810.GA1132@sol.localdomain/.

Thanks,
