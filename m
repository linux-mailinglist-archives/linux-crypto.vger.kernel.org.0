How are you and your family today,

I hope everything is alright? I'm sorry for the late reply,
I am very happy to inform you of my success in translating these funds
into cooperation with a new partner of Portugal. Currently, I am in
Qatar for investment projects with a share of the total amount that I
invest in real estate.
Meanwhile, I have not forgotten your past efforts and attempts to help
me in the transfer of these funds, despite the fact that this is not
for us, as for some. Now, contact Orabank through their contacts, as
described below, and ask them to send you an amount of $ 1,200,000.00
, which I have retained for your compensation for all your past
efforts and attempts to help me in this matter.

I appreciated your efforts. So do not hesitate and contact him and ask
him what to do to receive your fund.At the moment I am very busy here
for investment projects.
I wish you a happy time of your life.
Your daily thoughts.
