It's inherently more complex to have multiple alternate implementations, and it
reduces testability because there's no obvious way to even test your 32-bit
version on x86_64 (which most developers use), as it seems your 64-bit version
always gets built instead.

Now, it's possible that the performance gain outweighs this, and I too would
like to have the C implementation of Poly1305 be faster.  So if you'd like to
argue for the performance gain, fine, and if there's a significant performance
gain I don't have an objection.  But I'm not sure why you're at the same time
trying to argue that *adding* an extra implementation somehow makes the code
easier to audit and doesn't add complexity...
