> Hi all,

Hey Hannes, nice progress. This is definitely
a step in the right direction.

Please call out the TP 8006 specifically so people can look
into it.

Glad to see this turned out to be very simple!

TLS is an additional effort, as discussed, inband auth alone
has merits and we should not lock it down to NVMe/TCP-TLS.

Having another look into this now...
