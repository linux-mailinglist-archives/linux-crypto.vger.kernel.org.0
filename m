Fair.

This is tricky. We explored a solution that was enqueuing to a sw queue
when the hw queue was full and then re-submitting in the callback.
Didn't work due to response ordering.

We are looking at using the crypto-engine for this. However, since that
patch is not ready, we can use your solution for the time being.
I asked our validation team to run our regression suite on your patch
set.

Herbert answered already this question :-)

From bdc48fa11 I see that "80 columns is certainly still _preferred_".
80 is still my preference.
I can fix this and send a v2.

Yes, I understood this. My question was about the actual number.
93% of the depth of the queue.

Ok makes sense. Thanks.
