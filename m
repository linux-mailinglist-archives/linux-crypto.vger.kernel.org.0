I'd be worried if the compiler optimised it away :)

Just because p is not NULL, it does not follow that (p + X) where
X is a small integer is also not NULL.  Sure it happens to be
true in kernel space but that's something that we'd have to explicitly
tell the compiler and I don't think there is any way for us to
communicate that through.

BTW that was just a completely wild guess on my part based on how
distros operate.  I just had a quick look and it seems that Debian
at least disables this option but Fedora leaves it on.

I know.

Not surprising as it's doing atomic ops on contended memory.  At
least this patch series kills two of those atomic ops.

Yes I would certainly be open to such a patch.  Another avenue to
explore is turning the atomic ops into percpu/local ones similar
to what networking does to its counters.
