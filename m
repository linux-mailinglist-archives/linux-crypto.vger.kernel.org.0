That is what we originally had on arm64, with per-CPU buffers of the
appropriate size. This became a bit messy when SVE support was added,
because the register file is so large (32 registers of up to 2048 bits
each), and since the kernel does not use SVE itself, we want the inner
per-CPU buffer to only cover 128 bits per register. This means we
cannot allow the <sirq></sirq> region above to interrupt the outer
preserve (which is implemented entirely in software), since resuming
the outer preserve after a sirq would preserve content that was
corrupted by the inner preserve/restore. This could be addressed by
disabling interrupts across the outer preserve, but this caused a
problem somewhere else (Dave might remember the details better than I
do). So we ended up making SIMD in task context mutually exclusive
with SIMD in softirq context, also because that is what 32-bit ARM and
x86 were already doing as well.

But I understand that these concerns may not apply to x86 at all, so
perhaps the answer there is indeed to have a alternate buffer. And
actually, Andy L. suggested the same when I asked him about it on IRC.
