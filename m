It's a universal keyed hash. Which you could use as a MAC, although, admitt=
edly,
it would be rather weak, which is why the tag is usually additionally encry=
pted.
(which you could do externally, knowing that that's needed with GHASH)
In any case, the crypto API's ghash does not do what you would expect of a =
GHASH.

"Anyone" may actually know what they're doing. But rely on ghash being GHAS=
H ...
So this is a rather lame argument.

Ok, I understand that it's legacy so maybe we should keep it as is.
It's terribly confusing though - I spent days trying to get my acceleration=
 to
work (i.e. pass testmgr) only to realise after reverse engineering the gene=
ric=20
implementation that it's not really ghash at all.

I guess the real problem is that this information can currently only be=20
obtained by fully reverse engineering the implementation. And I'm a firm
believer in the natural order of things: programmers write code, compilers=
=20
read code, not the other way around ...

>=20
I guess my constructive suggestion *for the future* would be to be more car=
eful
with the naming. Don't give something a "known" name if it does not comply =
with
the matching specification. Renaming stuff now is probably counter-producti=
ve,
but putting some remarks somewhere (near the actual test vectors may work?)
about implementation x not actually being known entity X would be nice.
(Or even just some reference on where the test vectors came from!)
