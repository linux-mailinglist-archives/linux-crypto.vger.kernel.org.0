The RFC does not seem to put any restrictions on the MKTs used with a
TCP connection, except that every segment must match at most one MKT,
where the matching is done on the socket pair and for incoming
segments on the KeyID, and for outgoing segments by designating a
desired MKT.
If I understand what you suggest for the initial commit, socket pair
matching would not be done, and user level (together with out-of-band
coordination between peers) would be responsible for making sure that
the segments' socket pairs are consistent with the implied socket
pairs of the MKTs on the socket. Failure to do that would be
considered a misconfiguration and would result in undefined behavior.
Is that correct?
Even if the MKT's socket pair is not used in the initial commit, would
it help having it in the API, to avoid future incompatibilities with
user level? Or would it be understood that user level code using the
initial commit may have to change with future commits?
