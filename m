PK: I discussed this with my hardware team and their response is as below.

"Besides the bus interface (base address) and interrupt described in
the new binding there are standard power and clock and possibly a
reset interface. However, these have no influence on the driver, so
are not included in the dts to keep things simple.
The hardware IP can be configured to run synchronously to the bus or
have a clock crossing, but as there is no notion of time/frequency in
the driver that's not relevant to the driver.
Same for power signals, there is no additional power management in the IP b=
lock.
If you prefer power/clock/reset to be added, can you please point us
to an example which you consider best practice that we can follow?"

PK: The SPAcc, is also tested on "nsimosci", which is an ARC based
environment. This is our real use case. We already have the ARC dts
files upstreamed as shown below

linux/arch/arc/boot/dts/skeleton.dtsi
linux/arch/arc/boot/dts/skeleton_hs.dtsi
linux/arch/arc/boot/dts/nscimosci.dts
linux/arch/arc/boot/dts/nscimosci_hs.dts

I can add a SPAcc device node to
linux/arch/arc/boot/dts/nscimosci_hs_spacc.dts and accordingly create
the dts yaml bindings. With this change my SPAcc yaml binding is going
to look like the below snippet.

-------------------------------------------------------------
properties:
  compatible:
      - items:
          - const: snps,skeleton_hs-spacc
          - const: snps,dwc-spacc

  reg:
    maxItems: 1

  interrupts:
    maxItems: 1

  clocks:
    maxItems: 1

  ...
  ...

required:
  - compatible
  - reg
  - interrupts

additionalProperties: false

examples:
  - |
    #include <dt-bindings/interrupt-controller/arc-intc.h>

    crypto@40000000 {
        compatible =3D "snps,skeleton_hs-spacc", "snps,dwc-spacc";
