I don't think we can, to be honest. We need to have a deprecation path
for obsolete and insecure algorithms: the alternative is to keep
supporting a long tail of broken crypto indefinitely.

This is the first time this has been reported on an upstream kernel list.

As you know, I went out of my way to ensure that this removal would
happen as smoothly as possible, which is why I contributed code to
both iwd and libell beforehand, and worked with distros to ensure that
the updated versions would land before the removal of ARC4 from the
kernel.

It is unfortunate that one of the distros failed to take that into
account for the backport of a newer kernel to an older distro release,
but I don't think it is fair to blame that on the process.

Thanks for reporting that.

So what is your timeline for retaining MD4 support in iwd? You are
aware that it has been broken since 1991, right? Please, consider
having a deprecation path, so we can at least agree on *some* point in
time (in 6 months, in 6 years, etc) where we can start culling this
junk.
