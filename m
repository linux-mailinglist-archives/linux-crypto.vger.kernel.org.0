The CCM change in the last patch uncovers this issue, and I don't
think it is likely we would ever hit it anywhere else.

The difference is that zero sized inputs never make sense for
skciphers, but for AEADs, they could occur, even if they are uncommon
(the AEAD could have associated data only, and no plain/ciphertext)

But in the general case, I would assume that skcipher_walk_done() can
be called on a walk that was successfully started with
skcipher_walk_virt() without crashing, even if the scatterlist has
size zero, so perhaps we should fix that one as well.
