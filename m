Then why not work with the distros to get these changes merged into the
kernel tree?  They know that keeping things out-of-the-tree costs them
time and money, so why are they keeping them there?

I recommend getting the distros to chime in on what their requirements
are for the random code would probably be best as they are the ones that
take on the "random fips requirement of the day" more than anyone else.

What exactly do vendors "want to achieve"?  Where are they saying this?

I see nothing on that slide that mentions actual requirements other than
"the current code does not match this random government regulation".

Please provide valid reasons, from distros.
