Are you referring to the line

CT[j] = AES_CBC_CS_ENCRYPT(Key[i], PT[j])

where the CTS transform is invoked without an IV altogether? That
simply seems like a bug to me. In an abstract specification like this,
it would be insane for pseudocode functions to be stateful objects,
and there is nothing in the pseudocode that explicitly captures the
'output IV' of that function call.

OK. So given that that neither the CTS spec nor this document makes
any mention of an output IV or what its value should be, my suggestion
would be to capture the IV directly from the ciphertext, rather than
relying on some unspecified behavior to give you the right data. Note
that we have other implementations of cts(cbc(aes)) in the kernel as
well (h/w accelerated ones) and if there is no specification that
defines this behavior, you really shouldn't be relying on it.


That 'specification' invokes AES_CBC_CS_ENCRYPT() twice using a
different prototype, without any mention whatsoever what the implied
value of IV[] is if it is missing. This is especially problematic
given that it seems to cover all of CS1/2/3, and the relation between
next IV and ciphertext is not even the same between those for inputs
that are a multiple of the blocksize.
