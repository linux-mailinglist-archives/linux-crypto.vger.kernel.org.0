I will submit this as a patch as soon as I work out how to handle it
in the kernel makefiles. That is not likely to be very soon since
those files are a bit complex, I'm new to them, & I have other things
on my plate just now.

In the meanwhile, it seems worth asking for comments and/or for advice
on the makefiles.

/*
 * Program to select random numbers for initialising things
 * in the random(4) driver.
 *
 * Sandy Harris sandyinchina@gmail.com
 *
 * In general, this falls well short of the ideal solution,
 * which would give every installation (rather than every
 * compiled kernel) a different seed.
 * For that, see John Denker's suggestions at:
 * http://www.av8n.com/computer/htm/secure-random.htm#sec-boot-image
 *
 * However, if every installation compiles a new kernel
 * then this becomes equivalent to Denker's suggestion,
 * or perhaps even better because it uses more random
 * material.
 *
 * Inserting random data at compile time can do no harm and
 * will make some attacks considerably harder. It is not an
 * ideal solution, and not absolutetely necessary, but cheap
 * and probably the best we can do during the build (rather
 * than install) process.
 *
 * This is not strictly necessary if any of these apply:
 *
 *      you have a trustworthy hardware RNG
 *      your CPU has a trustworthy random number instruction
 *      you have secure stored random data
 *
 * In those cases, the device can easily be initialised well;
 * the only difficulty is to ensure that is done early enough.
 * On the other hand, this is easy to do, and even if one or
 * more other methods are used as well this adds a layer for
 * defense in depth.
 *
 * The program takes one optional single-digit command-line option,
 * how many 512-bit contexts to initialise in addition to the
 * input pool
 *      -0, just the pool
 *      -1, initialise a context for Chacha as well
 *          (useful with current driver)
 *      -2, Chacha context plus a 512-bit hash context
 *          (possibe in future driver)
 * If no option is given, it defaults to just the pool.
 *
 * The program:
 *
 *      gets its data from /dev/urandom
 *      produces different output every time it runs
 *      limits the range of Hamming weights
 *      each byte has at least one bit 1, at least one 0
 *
 *      output is formatted as an array declaration
 *      suitable for inclusion by random.c
 *      declared as 64-bit unsigned to align it
 *      writes to stdout, expecting makefile to redirect
 *
 * makefile should also delete the output file after it is
 * used in compilation of random.c, ideally using a secure
 * deletion tool such as shred(1) srm(1) or wipe(1).
 * This forces the file to be rebuilt and a new version
 * used in every compile. It also prevents an enemy just
 * reading an output file in the build directory and
 * getting the data that is used in the current kernel.
 *
 * This is not full protection since they might look in
 * the kernel image or even in the running kernel. But
 * if an enemy has enough privileges to look in those
 * places, then the random driver is nowhere near the
 * most serious security worry.
 *
 * This is certainly done early enough and the data is random
 * enough, but it is not necessarily secret enough.
 *
 * For any machine that compiles its own kernel, this alone might
 * be enough to ensure secure initialisation since only an enemy
 * who already has root could discover this data. Of course even
 * there it should not be used alone, only as one layer of a
 * defense in depth.
 *
 * If a kernel is compiled once then installed on many machines
 * (for example used for an embedded device or in a Linux distro)
 * this is likely of very little value. It complicates an attack
 * somewhat, and might even be too much for some attackers, but
 * it clearly will not stop a serious attacker who has access
 * to another copy of the distro or the device. It may not even
 * slow them down much.
 *
 * In many cases there is a choice. An administrator who
 * distributes software to every machine in an organisation
 * could either compile once and give them all the same kernel
 * or produce a different kernel for each machine; the latter
 * course is not remarkably difficult or expensive.
 *
 * A Linux distro might suggest that users compile a new
 * kernel, or even require it as part of the install
 * process. This might be useful quite apart from the
 * random device, building a kernel optimised for the
 * customer's hardware.
