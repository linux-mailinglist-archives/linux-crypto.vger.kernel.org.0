Hi Jason, Dave,

Some late feedback on CONFIG_WIREGUARD_DEBUG.

Does it really do "verbose debug log"? I only see it is used for
self-tests and debug checks:

linux$ grep DEBUG drivers/net/wireguard/*.c
drivers/net/wireguard/allowedips.c: WARN_ON(IS_ENABLED(DEBUG) && *len >= 128);
drivers/net/wireguard/allowedips.c: WARN_ON(IS_ENABLED(DEBUG) && len
>= 128);                      \
drivers/net/wireguard/main.c:#ifdef DEBUG
drivers/net/wireguard/noise.c: WARN_ON(IS_ENABLED(DEBUG) &&

There are 3 different things:
 - boot self-tests
 - additional debug checks
 - verbose logging

In different contexts one may enable different sets of these.
In particular in fuzzing context one absolutely wants additional debug
checks, but not self tests and definitely no verbose logging. CI and
various manual scenarios will require different sets as well.
If this does verbose logging, we won't get debug checks as well during
fuzzing, which is unfortunate.
Can make sense splitting CONFIG_WIREGUARD_DEBUG into 2 or 3 separate
configs (that's what I see frequently). Unfortunately there is no
standard conventions for anything of this, so CIs will never find your
boot tests and fuzzing won't find the additional checks...
