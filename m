Yes, really. The likelihood of a test vector occurring in practice is
entirely irrelevant. What matters is that the test vectors provide
known outputs for known inputs, and many algorithm specifications
explicitly contain the empty message as one of the documented test
vectors.

In fact, given the above, I am slightly shocked that your hardware
does not handle empty messages correctly. Are you sure it is a
hardware problem and not a driver problem?

In any case, as Eric points out as well, nothing is stopping you from
adding a special case to your driver that falls back to the software
implementation for known broken test cases.

Removing test cases from the set because of broken hardware is out of
the question IMO. It doesn't actually fix the problem, and it may
actually result in breakage, especially for h/w accelerated crypto
exposed to userland, of which we have no idea whatsoever how it is
being used, and whether correct handling of zero length vectors is
likely to break anything or not.

You are making assumptions about how the crypto is being used at a
higher level. Eric's example may not make sense to you, but arguing
that *any* use of sha256sum on empty files is guaranteed to be
non-sensical in all imaginable cases is ridiculous.

Again, that is shocking to me, since it means nobody has ever bothered
to run, e.g., the documented SHA-xxx test vectors on them. Weird.
