The IV actually is generated with an IV generator (I think it is the SEQIV 
generator from crypto/seqiv.c - it is set in the XFRM framework). It is a 
deterministic construction XORed with a random number from the SP800-90A DRBG.

See above, it is actually not the SPI, or sequence number, it is what the IV 
generator provides.

req->iv is your IV.

The use of the IV as part of the AAD is just a use case for rfc4106. Although 
I doubt that the rfc4106 structure will change any time soon, I would not use 
the IV from the AAD but only look at the req->iv.

Right, it is a perfectly legal way of doing it, but it is currently not done 
that way in the kernel. Thus, I would reiterate my suggestion from above to 
always use req->iv as your IV.

Precisely.
