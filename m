It's still an Arm thing, so it would need at least an 'arm,' prefix.
But ideally it wouldn't be Arm specific though I'm not sure if any
such thing is needed for other arches. If common either for Arm or
across arches, then it needs to be documented in a common doc with
some wider agreement than what a device specific property needs.

That's already a requirement in general. Sometimes we can avoid it,
but that's cases of getting lucky.

If your DT is part of firmware, then waiting until adding some driver
feature or quirk based on a new DT property is too late. Whereas with
a SoC specific compatible, you can handle any new feature or quirk
without a DT change (e.g. just a stable kernel update). Some platforms
may not care about that model, but in general that's the policy we
follow. Not doing that, we end up with the DWC3 binding.

A fallback compatible is how we avoid updating drivers for every
single SoC unless needed.
