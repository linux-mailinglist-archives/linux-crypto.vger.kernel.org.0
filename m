Would it necessarily have been a host bug?  A guest telling the host a
bad GPA to DMA into would trigger this wouldn't it?

Still; I wonder if it's best to kill the guest - maybe it's best for
the host to kill the guest and leave behind diagnostics of what
happened; for someone debugging the crash, it's going to be less useful
to know that page X was wrongly accessed (which is what the guest would
see), and more useful to know that it was the kernel's vhost-... driver
that accessed it.
