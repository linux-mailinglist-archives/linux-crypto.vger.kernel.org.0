Thanks a lot for providing a detailed description of the series
of events that have led to this patch!

Removing the defaults from the Kconfig would be a much better
solution, but I'm afraid it would actually be quite disruptive,
requiring changes to various kernel configurations.

The only upside of the current solution is that it represents
the least disruptive approach.

I'd suggest that this patch is kept as-is, and I'd add another
patch on top of it, which would remove the defaults from the
Kconfig and update the relevant default configs, of course if
the maintainers are fine with such an approach, and if there
is general agreement toward getting rid of the defaults.

Having two patches, as proposed above, would make the bisecting
later much easier, in case some unforeseen issues are discovered
in the future.
