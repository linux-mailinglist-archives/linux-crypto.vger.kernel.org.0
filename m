This does not actually work. The kernel_fpu_end() occurring in the
CRC-T10 code amounts to a voluntary schedule, which means
synchronize_rcu_tasks() does not guarantee that the accelerated code
is no longer live after the static call is updated to refer to the
generic code again, and so the remove is risky.

There are some other issues I want to focus on first, so I am going to
disregard this series for now.
