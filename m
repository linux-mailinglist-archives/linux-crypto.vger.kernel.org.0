Well, the problem is that it isn't well defined what the cra_blocksize property
actually means.  Depending on the algorithm, it can mean either the minimum
input size, the required alignment of the input size, the exact input size that
is required (in the case of block ciphers), or the input size that is required
by the algorithm's internal compression function (in the case of hashes).

"xts" follows the convention of cra_blocksize meaning the "minimum input size",
as do "cts" and "adiantum" which have the same constraints on input sizes as
"xts".

So I'm not sure that changing cra_blocksize for xts to 1 would accomplish
anything useful, other than confuse things further.
