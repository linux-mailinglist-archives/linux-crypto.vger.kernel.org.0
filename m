1. AES/PKE engine inside DTHEv2 is DPA and EMA resistant.

2. Certification like SESIP, PSA and
IEC62443(being certified for CIP kernel- LFX [1])
All these have requirements for sidechannel attacks resistance.(check
lvl 3+)
Most of our users have these requirements and they don't even care about
performance in terms of speed.

3. We have devices in kerneCI and we have regular testing and engineers
working on acceleratprs internally too, we can be more careful about
that these drivers are going through prescribed testing for all
revisions.

We can reduce the prority for hw Accelerator by default if that's what
you're trying to imply and let users decide.

I don't understand why you call it harmful when it is providing the
security against side channel attacks.

If ARM itself prescribing to use crypto acclerators if they are
avialable, then it is beyond my understanding why would you push towards
using CE extensions.[3]

Are we not serious about the security than the performance itself?

For us,
Point 1 and 2 is at top priority and being a SOC vendor we want to make
sure that we provide all support that is needed by end customers for
their threat modeling.  

For embedded systems, resource utilization is also very important,
I can use crypto accelerator and save CPU for other activities

But lets look at numbers, They are not 50x worse as you have mentioned in
earlier mail, they are just 2x bad. These a system with one core cpu
833Mhz and DTHEv2 at 400Mhz
