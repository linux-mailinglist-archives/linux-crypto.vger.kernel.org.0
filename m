Yes, thanks, I missed the case where deferred_grow_zone could stop
mid-max-order-block.

Maybe it's better to leave deferred_init_maxorder alone and adapt the
multithreading to the existing implementation.  That'd mean dealing with the
pesky opaque index somehow, so deferred_init_mem_pfn_range_in_zone() could be
generalized to find it in the thread function based on the start/end range, or
it could be maintained as part of the range that padata passes to the thread
function.

Or, keep this patch but make sure deferred_grow_zone stops on a
max-order-aligned boundary.
