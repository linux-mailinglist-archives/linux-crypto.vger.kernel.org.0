Just because it more or less appeared to run, does NOT mean that it=20
actually works properly, reliably and efficiently across the board.=20
Trust me, this is my design and I know it inside out and there is NO=20
engine out there equal to any Marvell engine.

>=20
- specific algorithms supported
- number of pipes present
- number of rings present
- number of ring interrupt controllers present
- full featured (TRC) versus simplified record cache (STRC)
- for TRC: size of cache admin & data RAMs, affects configuration
- size of various internal buffers which affects configuration
- width of the databus, which affects descriptor size
- workarounds needed for specific design bugs and/or limitations
- newer features unsupported by now old MRVL engines

That's just the low-hanging fruit. We've *never* delivered the same
engine configuration to different customers. It's always customized.

"No firmware" is not possible with an EIP197. Trying to use it without
loading firmware will cause it to hang, which I don't believe is what
you would want. So the alternative would be to return an error, which
is fine by me, so then I'll change it into that as default.

Ah, ok, your point being not to touch an already existing comment.
I missed that tiny detail ... I guess that's sort of automatic out of
my desire for consistency. I'll try to suppress those urges :-)

Sure, I can add some comments to clarify these.

We can discuss all we want, but the old approach for sure won't work
so there's no point in keeping those (effectively redundant up until
now, so why did they even exist?) 'engines' flags.=20

I can remove them, I was just wondering if there was actually any=20
rationale for not wanting to have them (considering that that at least
seems far more error prone). I have this strange desire to want to=20
know WHY I have to do something before I do it.

Is it just to show off your intimate knowledge of C operator precedence
and associativity  ;-) (which, incidentally, I'm not too familiar with)

No, they will not. Certainly not if the driver becomes more capable.
You are making (dangerous) assumptions you don't have the knowledge
to make. With all due respect, not your fault, you just can't know
as this is not public information.

No, that's naive thought. Marvell configs, for example, have a pretty
extensive algorithm loadout and relatively large record cache RAMs
as well as internal buffer RAMs. That will cause problems with most
other engines being a subset of that (which may be reliability=20
problems you won't immediately notice(!) ...).

> And the version could be in both cases something like 'EIP97'.
>=20
It needs to be something unique. And that will very quickly become
overwhelming as you need to maintain lists of which unique identifier
has which specific features somewhere. Or have huge case and/or=20
if-else if statements all over the place.

While all required parameters needed to configure the engine and
the driver can be directly probed from said hardware (including the
difference between an EIP97 and an EIP197, the number of pipes,
rings, everything, all you need is a base address), so why bother?

The only place where this 'version' can still be useful is to=20
distinguish the *platform*, which may need some specific initialization=20
(e.g. platform clocks, power domains, interrupt controllers and such).

>=20
Knowing the hardware better is actually a huge understatement, being the
responsible architect and lead designer :-) I specified and implemented
most of the stuff you are talking from the driver with my own two hands.

That's an interesting remark as that is exactly what I am trying to
*avoid* through the way I'm using the version field and, for me,
contradicts some comments you had earlier?
Oh well, I'll take this statement as confirmation we're more or less
on the same page here.=20
