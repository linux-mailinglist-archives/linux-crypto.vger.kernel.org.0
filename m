And also takes care of other quibbles that were rattling around in my =

Then the constraints are even better. If that output isn't directly =
exposed, it can be a bit sloppier.=20

Yeah, I was thinking it would be direct output. If it's direct output, =
then a ciphertext-only attack on the cipher is an attack on the PRNG. =
The way you're using it, it's a cheap way to provide another safety net. =
Remember, though, that E-M assumes a PRP, and many breaks on ciphers =
imply that it's not a PRP, and yet you don't care about any of that. =
Sounds fine to me.

The speed aspect on low-end CPUs is what I was thinking of. Most =
importantly, you are doing something inside the whole box, so it doesn't =
even really need full pseudorandomness.=20

Overall, sounds fine to me.
