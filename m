>=20
It may not need to be 100% identical, sure, but I would still assert that t=
he odds
of hitting the same obscure corner case bug may not be as high as you might=
 hope.
And for me,  "repeatable" means that I can *depend* on hitting it and don't=
 need
to be "lucky" on the next boot. My recent personal experiences are not so g=
ood :-(

What's more tricky: now I implemented a fix. So my *expectation* is that it=
 passes.
And it actually does. But does that mean my fix *really* worked? Or am I ju=
st not
hitting the relevant corner case anymore? Perhaps even due to my change its=
elf
influencing the random generation? How do I possibly know for sure?'

I may end up submitting a patch that does not work at all. It may even intr=
oduce a
new corner case issue that's not hit either. If there's a lot of people out=
 there
trying my patch I may have a reasonable chance one of them finds the proble=
m,
but fact of the matter is, AFAIK, I only have one person able to try my pat=
ches.

Ok, oops, I did not mean for that to be a rant.  And I'm usually pretty ver=
bose, so=20
feel free to TL;DR :-)

I did have a quick look at the random generation to see if I could fix the =
seed but=20
it currently seems to be global per CPU, not just for testmgr, so probably =
no=20
guarantee to get the same sequence inside testmgr even if I do manage to fi=
x=20
that seed (but I didn't try yet).

To give you an honest answer on that last question: lack of time and skills=
.
I'm not a software engineer and my boss merely tolerates me working on the=
=20
driver, so I can only spend idle cycles on this.

Lazyness has very little to do with it. Adding generated vectors to testmgr=
.h just
feels like a waste of effort and space, as you could generate them on-the-f=
ly.
(if the generic implementation is known to be good for those cases)

It will increase the kernel size and boot time.  Beyond what threshold that=
 will be=20
considered bloat is in the eye of the beholder I suppose. And some corner c=
ases
(i.e. length restrictions, hash block size boundaries, counter sizes, ...) =

require significant lengths, so with so many cipher suites that adds up qui=

Ok, I guess that would solve the bloat issue as well (not counting testmgr.=

The only vectors I have easy access to are the ones we use to verify our HW=
.
And that's exactly the problem here - these are often cases that we don't f=
ormally=20
support with our HW and require driver workarounds. Hence, I don't have
those vectors readily available.

Sounds like a plan, but easier said than done ... relevant corner cases may
differ from cipher suite to cipher suite so you need some way to control th=
e
random generation of the various parameters from alg_test_descs[x].
But OK, fair enough, I'll try and see if I can come up with something mysel=
f ...=20
if I can find some cycles to actually work on that ... don't hold you breat=
h for it.
