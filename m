Thx, now I understand things better. I also had a small hope that my
prodding here might motivate someone to look into this, but that didn't
happen. Well, that's how it is.

I'm not totally sure if this regression was handled like Linus would
have want it to be handled. But I guess it's not worth bringing him in
-- among others because it took so long for somebody to complain. I'll
thus strop tracking this now.

#regzbot resolve: tricky situation that remains unresolved for now

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)

If I did something stupid, please tell me, as explained on that page.
