Yes, EC calculations are very fast, this is why EC cryptography is
gaining more and more popularity.

There's too much politics and procedures involved here. Even in the
current scope it took more, than 2 years to get the spec officially done
(I started proposing it early 2018). Maybe, in future, if someone comes
in the the committee with the corresponding proposal and value
justification.

Although, frankly speaking, with DH exponentials reuse I personally
don't see much value in ECDH in this application. Maybe, only for very
small embedded devices with really limited computational capabilities.

Sure, I understand.

Yes, please. Otherwise, people might start talking that Linux NVMe-oF
authentication is too bad and slow.
