Hi Paul,

Sorry I missed your reply earlier. I'm not a subscriber so I missed this
as I somehow fell out of the CC.

Source code compatibility isn't exactly a bad goal. But according to
Adhemerval you don't plan on this being a secure thing -- hence
mentioning as such in the documentation as he mentioned -- so it seems
like a maybe-okay goal gone bad. But, anyway, if the goal is just basic
source code compatibility, back it with simple calls to getrandom() to
start, and if later there are performance issues (big if!), we can look
into vDSO tricks and such to speed that up. There's no need to add a
whole new huge fraught mechanism for that.

Well that's good. I'd recommend just backing it out until it can be done
in a way that glibc developers feel comfortable calling safe (and others
too, of course, but at the very least you don't want to start out making
something you feel the need to warn about in the documentation).

I'm happy to help with this if you need. I recently cleaned up some
stuff similar sounding in systemd for their uses; random-util.c there
might be of interest.
