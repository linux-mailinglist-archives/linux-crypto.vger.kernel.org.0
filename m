Hi Stephan,

Yes, but you can't get rid of DRBG either. That'd require getting rid of
CRYPTO_RNG_DEFAULT, which means you cannot even have CRYPTO_GENIV?

Hmm. Maybe it _is_ possible to get rid of all these.

Well, CRYPTO_FIPS also would break our testing, since we still have to
support WEP/TKIP (RC4-based) ...

Well it _looks_ like it might be possible to get rid of it (see above),
however, what I was really thinking is that jitter RNG might detect that
it doesn't actually get any reasonable data and eventually give up,
rather than looping indefinitely? It seems that might be useful more
generally too?
