Or, from a different angle: You're trying to allocate memory, and you
can't make forward progress until that memory has been allocated
(unless the process is killed). That's what GFP_KERNEL is for. Stuff
like "__GFP_NOWARN | __GFP_NORETRY" is for when you have a backup plan
that lets you make progress (perhaps in a slightly less efficient way,
or by dropping some incoming data, or something like that), and it
hints to the page allocator that it doesn't have to try hard to
reclaim memory if it can't find free memory quickly.
