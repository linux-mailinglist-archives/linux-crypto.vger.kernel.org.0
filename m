Given that TPM 2.0 has been shipping in bulk since Windows 10 (2015)
and is required for Windows 11 (2021), are there really such huge
numbers of TPM 1.2 systems involved in security functions?

That's not the problem.  The problem is that sha1 is seen as a
compromised algorithm by NIST which began deprecating it in 2011 and is
now requiring it to be removed from all systems supplied to the US
government by 2030

https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2022/12/nist-retires-sha-1-cryptographic-algorithm

That means we have to control all uses of sha1 in the kernel and have
an option to build without it.  FIPS has an even tighter timetable: it
requires sha1 to be out by 2025.

Given that most CSOs follow NIST and FIPS it seems a little strange
that there would be a huge demand for such an intricate security
protocol as Dynamic Launch on a system that can't be FIPS 140-3
certified.
