Correct, as of now the compatible was not used to determine the hw caps,
the capabilities were retrieved by checking at runtime a version
register. I'm against adding a compatible that will not be used, in this
particular case, defining "microchip,sam9x7-tdes" in the driver but
still solely relying on the runtime version register interrogation.
Unfortunately the commit message does not reveal any intention and from
there these emails changed. Maybe it's just a matter of personal
preference, so I'll stop commenting on this.

I didn't say the guideline is wrong, I just tried to understand how this

As you wish. I retrieve my NACK.
