The final mpi-sub-ui.c is not part of Gnu MP, but heavily based on it
sounds very accurate to me.

Correct. The copyright line I used matches the original copyright from
Gnu MP.

The "This file is part..." line and the Note is the same from
mpi/lib/mpi-powm.c.

However I'm proposing the removal of that part in favor of the new
header I listed below based on Gnu MP header.

I haven't looked at the GnuPG code at all. Neither while I was
preparing this patch, neither after or before. So I can affirm this
patch has no influence of GnuPG code at all.

But if you want to be sure I can check that. Please let me know.

As I said, the GnuPG reference came from me trying to re-use the
header from kernel's lib/mpi/mpi-powm.c file.

I can assure I haven't used any code from GnuPG at all.
