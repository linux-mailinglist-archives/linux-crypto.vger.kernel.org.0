You're not the only one :-) I have been intending to get the
discussion going with the networking folks, who rely heavily on this
as well.

Yes, that is the confusion. CONFIG_HAVE_EFFICIENT_UNALIGNED_ACCESS
should indicate whether using the unaligned accessors is fine in all
cases, or whether you should find other ways to load the data more
efficiently (compare NET_IP_ALIGN, which shifts the entire IP header
so the 32-bit address field appear aligned in memory)

CONFIG_HAVE_EFFICIENT_UNALIGNED_ACCESS does *not* mean that you can
simply cast any pointer to any type and dereference it, but the
meaning appears to have shifted this way over the years (and the
Documentation/ was even updated to this effect)

Pre-v6 ARM (and MIPS as well, IIRC) require byte sized accesses and
shift/or sequences to do unaligned accesses, whereas v6 and up simply
allows ldr from a misaligned address. So in the former case, you could
use cra_alignmask to align the data in memory, while the latter case
can ignore it. (arch/arm/crypto/aes-cipher-glue.c uses this as well)
