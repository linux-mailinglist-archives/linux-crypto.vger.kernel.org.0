Yes, precisely. In fact, it is the identical code base of the core=20
functionality that both the kernel and the jitterentropy-rngd uses. See the=
=20
comment at the top of the kernel source code.

If you compile it and you also have AF_ALG for RNGs compiled, you can use i=
t=20
through the AF_ALG interface (see [1] for a library). But IMHO if you are=20
space-constrained, you do not want that code.

Rather use the jitterentropy-library from [2] and link it straight from you=
r=20
application.

It is intended for in-kernel purposes (namely to seed its DRBG).
