Of course you can, that's what the security proofs for crypto constructions
always do.  They prove that no efficient attack exists (in some attack model)
unless the underlying crypto primitives are weak.

Obviously there are people already using bad crypto, whether this or something
else, and they often need to continue to be supported.  I'm not disputing that.

What I'm disputing is your willingness to argue that it's not really that bad,
without a corresponding formal proof which crypto constructions always have.
