Hey Eric.

Thanks for your fast reply :-)

Good :-)

[X]Chacha, IIRC, would anyway be used without XTS...

Well, I personally don't use any others, but of course other might.
What about all these legacy modes that were used for years in examples,
like cast5-cbc-essiv, aes-cbc-essiv, etc.?

Does your list have any effects on things like chained algos (which I
think cryptsetup allows to use for tcrypt).

For me they are. Actually I would want to replace my use of twofish by
something xchacha based (see * below), but I would want to keep xts-
serpent in the long term.

I see. Well at least 2.8.6 still needed it for opening a dm-crypt
device that used serpent-xts-plain64.

While these cases won't affect me, legacy users should be kept in mind.

Perhaps waiting a few years where opening such dm-crypt mapping merely
gives a warning that this is about to go away, then - if possible - for
a few years allowing read-only mappings.

Good to hear that you guys have it already on your radar, that some
people may use these non-AES algos and may want to continue doing so
even in the long term.
So please keep this in mind. :-)


Thanks,
Chris.


* A bit off topic, but since some of the relevant people are already in
CC:

I've wrote just before on the cryptsetup mailing list, that we have the
nice integrity support in cryptsetup for quite some years now, but I
guess only few people actually use it because all the available
algorithms/modes were kinda recommended against[0].

I think XChacha20+Poly1305 might be in reach (but still not actually
usable?), having finally a large enough nonce (192bits?).

Now I'm not a crypt export, so don't really know which of [X]Chacha20
vs. AES256 is considered stronger.
At least AES has probably received far more scrutiny than any other
crypto algo ever.

So any chances that the kernel provides a usable AEAD mode for AES (or
maybe even Serpent ;-P)?=C2=A0

Like with GCM but a larger nonce?
Or what about EAX, OCB? I blindly assume, that the patents have all
expired, given that OpenPGP now uses them since RFC 9580.
