Because it's not the same thing to enable everything and to add one extra
alg. This makes bissecting the driver harder because one would not except
this change in this kind of patch.

OK, that answer my question and this makes sense.

That's where I disagree as you need extra knowledge to be aware of this.
Being explicit removes any possible question one may ask. But that's a
small point really :)
