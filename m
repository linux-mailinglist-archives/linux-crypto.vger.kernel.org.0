Thanks for the responses Andy.

Having a way for userspace to lock pages as shared was an idea I just
proposed the simplest solution to start the conversation. So what we
could do here is change map to error if the selected region has
private pages, if the region is mapped we can then lock the pages
shared. Now processes mapping guest memory that are well behaved can
be safe from RMP violations. That seems like a reasonable solution for
allowing userspace to know if guest memory is accessible or not. Or do
you have other ideas to meet your other comment:
