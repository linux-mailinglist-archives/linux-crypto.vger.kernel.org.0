Yes, definitely. For the userspace approach I would think only
asymmetric algorithms. For "reliability issues" I don't know if it is
a problem of the kernel itself, or the user/admin of the system. The
kernel supports network-based and userspace-based filesystems and
userspace-based block devices even and users successfully use them as
root filesystems. Surely a small crypto agent running locally would
not be worse than this.

Can you elaborate on this? (I want to understand for myself). I think
keyctl UAPIs for private keys are a great idea and allows building
good (and relatively simple) secure architectures. So I want to enable
more of this, not less.

It does make sense for userspace programs (apart from potential keyctl
users which don't want to have private keys in their address space),
but what about in-kernel services? How is this fundamentally different
from request_module, for example? If the kernel needs a module, it
tells userspace and there is a userspace helper, which provides it. It
is an "external service" to the kernel. So crypto can be another
service. After all, microkernels have been doing this forever.

What about sharing code at the binary level? At Cloudflare we have an
internal kernel crypto driver, which just imports its implementation
directly from compiled BoringSSL into the kernel space. So in the end
it is fully in-kernel and fast, but the advantage is that the code
itself comes from BoringSSL (and we regularly update it). There are
rough edges of course (like using vector instructions, different stack
alignment etc), but it kinda works and I think with some investment we
can make such an approach upstream. We even considered open sourcing
it, but not sure about licensing as we effectively have a bespoke
"module loader" for BoringSSL, which is Apache (I hope James is right
that Apache may be considered GPL-2 compatible in the future).

While I think such an approach is much more technically challenging,
it provides "best of both worlds" by having fast in-kernel crypto
directly from established libraries.
