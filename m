The virtio queues need to be in sync with the host across suspend-
resume.  The usual workflow is qemu creates a device, Linux registers
the driver and maybe requests entropy at boot-up.  Later, when the
hibernation image is restored, the previously-running Linux's queue
indexes are used, which don't match with qemu's idea of where the
indexes will be.  This makes qemu terminate the guest.

To overcome this problem, the queues are removed before hibernate, and
recreated after resume -- which ensures both are in sync again.

I can imagine an addition to the virtio spec to re-initialize queues
for the hibernation use-case; but the current code path will have to be
around for the old-qemu usecase.
