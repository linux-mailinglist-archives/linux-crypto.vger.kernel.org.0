Right, it would be theoretically possible to have something like:

    static inline void hash(u32 supported_algos_bitmask, u32 algo,
                            const u8 *data, size_t len, u8 *out)
    {
            if ((supported_algos_bitmask & (1 << HASH_ALGO_SHA256)) &&
                algo == HASH_ALGO_SHA256)
                    sha256(data, len, out);
            else if ((supported_algos_bitmask & (1 << HASH_ALGO_SHA512)) &&
                    algo == HASH_ALGO_SHA512)
                    sha512(data, len, out);
            ... and so on
    }

And then something similar for init/update/final.  They'd have to take
in some sort of generic context type, which the caller would ensure is
sized to the maximum size needed by any supported algorithm.

I'm not sure I like this, though.  Just having the callers do it seems a
lot more straightforward.  (And again, crypto_shash remains an option
too.)

Of course, we should also keep in mind that usually in-kernel users only
want a single algorithm in the first place.  So this entire discussion
is about the less common case.
