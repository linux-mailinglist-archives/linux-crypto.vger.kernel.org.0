But many implementation do not return an output IV at all. The only
mode that requires it (for the selftests to pass) is CBC.

Given that in these cases, doing so will give incorrect results even
if the input size is a whole multiple of the block size, I agree that
adding this restriction will not break anything that is working
consistently at the moment.

But could you elaborate on the serious regression for other cases? Do
you have anything particular in mind?

For XTS, we would have to carry some metadata around that tells you
whether the initial encryption of the IV has occurred or not. In the
CTS case, you need two swap the last two blocks of ciphertext at the
very end.

So does that mean some kind of init/update/final model for skcipher? I
can see how that could address these issues (init() would encrypt the
IV for XTS, and final() would do the final block handling for CTS).
Just holding two blocks of data does not seem sufficient to me to
handle these issues.
