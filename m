Unfortunately this doesn't work because there are some skcipher algorithms
("cts" and "adiantum") that set cra_blocksize to their minimum message length
(16) rather than their length alignment requirement (1).  I.e., these algorithms
support all messages with length >= 16 bytes.

So before we can add this check, we need to get this straightened out.

I actually don't think "block size" should be a property of all crypto
algorithms at all, e.g. for skciphers we should instead have "min_msgsize" and
"msgsize_alignment".  The notion of "block size" is not meaningful for
length-preserving encryption algorithms in general, let alone all crypto
algorithms.  But unfortunately "block size" is pretty deeply embedded into the
crypto API, so it doesn't look easy to fix this...  Maybe for skciphers we could
get away with it always meaning the msgsize_alignment, though.
