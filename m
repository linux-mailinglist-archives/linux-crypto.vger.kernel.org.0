Agreed. But there is a difference, though. XTS and CBC-CTS are
guaranteed not to be used in a chaining manner today, given that there
is no possible way you could get the right output for a AF_ALG request
that has been split into several skcipher requests: XTS has the IV
encryption that occurs only once, and CBC-CTS has the unconditional
swapping of the last two blocks, which occurs even if the output is a
whole multiple of the block size. Doing either of these more than once
will necessarily result in corrupt output.

For cases where chaining is more straight-forward, we may have users
that we are unaware of, so it is trickier. But that only means that we
may need to require iv_out support for other modes than CBC and CTR,
not that we need to add complexity like this series is doing.

For now, I would prefer to simply introduce a 'permits chaining' flag
that only gets set for CBC and CTR, and without any special handling
to support chaining for modes where doing so is non-trivial and known
to be broken and thus unused anyway. algif_skcipher can then attempt
to allocate the skcipher with the 'permits chaining' flag, and fall
back to allocating without, and deal with the difference accordingly.
Then, we can start adding support for this where necessary, i.e.,
start with any generic skcipher templates that are needed for chaining
support, and add support to other implementations gradually. We should
also start adding iv_out test cases and conditionalize the test on
whether the skcipher has the 'permits chaining' flag set.

I don't think we need this at all.
