I'd be inclined to update CRYPTO_MINALIGN altogether, given that there
should be very few cases where this actually matter (we've had to fix
some non-coherent DMA issues in the past, but in the general case, all
buffers that are passed to devices for DMA should be described via
scatterlists, and I don't think we permit pointing the scatterlist
into request structures)
