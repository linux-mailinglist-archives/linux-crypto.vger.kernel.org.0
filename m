EINVAL is for invalid lengths while EBADMSG is for inauthentic inputs.
Inauthentic test vectors aren't yet automatically generated (even after this
patch), so I don't think EBADMSG should be seen here.  Are you sure there isn't
a bug in your patch that's causing this?

Regardless, something needs to be done about this test failure.  Generally, when
improving the tests I've sent out any needed fixes for the generic, x86, arm,
and arm64 software crypto algorithms first, since those are the most commonly
used and the easiest for most people to test.

I didn't get these error messages before this patch.  They start showing up
because this patch changes alg_test_null to alg_test_aead for algorithms with no
test vectors.

I'm simply suggesting adding the fields of 'struct aead_test_params' to
'struct aead_test_suite'.

Sure, but why is this patch making the length selectors specific to AEADs that
use separate authentication and encryption keys?  It should work for both.

Not sure why anyone would start a flame war.  This is just usual software
development: functions often get too long and complicated as people keep
patching in more stuff, so periodically there needs to be some refactoring to
keep the code understandable/maintainable/reviewable.  And I strongly believe
that contributors to the problem need to be responsible for doing their part,
and not assume that Someone Else will do it :-)

These are specific to AES, though.  So I'd expect to find them next to the plain
AES test vectors (aes_tv_template[]).

It would be the same number of passes.  One for each the actual generation, and
one in testmgr_onetime_init() to verify the numbers add up to exactly 100%.
(A verification pass would still be needed in the '.threshold' convention too,
to verify that the numbers are all < 100% and in increasing order.)

I'd rather optimize for making it easy to write and change the test vectors,
since those are much more lines of code than the .c code that runs the tests.

Thanks!
