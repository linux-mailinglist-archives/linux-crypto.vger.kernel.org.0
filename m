Hi!

I have sent out the v2 with the new function. To me, it does look 
cleaner. So thanks!

So, the logic is really. do "clearing of IV" in all cases. Do setting of 
initial IV only for HMAC. I tried the if..else like you said. It did not 
look correct to duplicate the code clearing the IV. So I have added 
comments around this section hopefully making it clearer. Do take a look 
and let me know. I can rework it further if you think so.
