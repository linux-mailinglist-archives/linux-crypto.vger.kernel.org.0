I have no objections to this patch.  However, I'd rather put
it on a topic branch which you could pull rather than pushing
it into 5.8 straight away.

I also dislike pulling in the kitchen sink when all you need in
consumer.h is the definition of suspend_state_t.  A better solution
would be to move the definition of suspend_state_t into linux/types.h
and including that instead of suspend.h in consumer.h.

Cheers,
