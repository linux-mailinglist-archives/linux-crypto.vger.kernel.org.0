=46or the code review:

Reviewed-by: Stephan M=FCller <smueller@chronox.de>

But with respect to the overall architecture of the seeding in the entire=20
kernel, this is insufficient (note, I am not saying that this patch series=
=20
should and can fix it though). It is insufficient, because:

=2D reseeding does not happen if new data is received by the kernel entropy=
=20
gathering functions like the RNDADDENTROPY IOCTL or add_hwgenerator_randomn=
ess=20
=2D i.e. externally provided data lingers without being used in the DRBG

=2D reseeding does not consider the amount of entropy added from the entrop=
y=20
sources allowing potential pathological weak reseeding operation

=2E.. and other seeding problems in random.c...

Ciao
Stephan
