I don't think that's accurate.  CBC and CTR are the only skciphers for which
this behavior is actually tested.  Everything else, not just stream ciphers but
all other skciphers, can be assumed to be broken.  Even when I added the tests
for "output IV" for CBC and CTR back in 2019 (because I perhaps
over-simplisticly just considered those to be missing tests), many
implementations failed and had to be fixed.  So I think it's fair to say that
this is not really something that has ever actually been important or even
supported, despite what the intent of the algif_skcipher code may have been.  We
could choose to onboard new algorithms to that convention one by one, but we'd
need to add the tests and fix everything failing them, which will be a lot.
