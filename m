As before you're actually talking about the "authenc" template for IPSec and not
about AEADs in general, right?  I'm not familiar with that algorithm, so you'll
have to research what the specification says, and what's actually using it.

Using an AEAD with authsize=0 is indeed silly, but perhaps someone using that in
some badly designed protocol where authentication is optional.  Also AFAICS from
the code, any authsize fits naturally into the algorithm; i.e., excluding 0
would be a special case.

But again, someone actually has to research this.  Maybe
crypto_aead_setauthsize() should simply reject authsize=0 for all AEADs.

What we should *not* do, IMO, is remove it from the tests and allow
implementations to do whatever they want.  If it's wrong we should fix it
everywhere, so that the behavior is consistent.
