The APX state is just 16 GPRs, for 128 bytes total.  That's about 5% of the size
of the fpstate (assuming AVX512 is supported).  As Dave mentioned, for in-kernel
use of APX it probably will make more sense to treat the new GPRs like the
existing ones, instead of using XSTATE and integrating it with kernel-mode FPU.
I.e., they will be saved/restored using plain moves to/from a dedicated buffer.

It's to keep kernel_fpu_begin()/end() working when hardirqs are disabled, since
local_bh_disable()/enable() require that hardirqs be enabled.  See the changelog
and https://lore.kernel.org/r/20250228035924.GC5588@sol.localdomain/.  There are
other directions we could go, but this seems to be the simplest solution.  If we
forbid kernel_fpu_begin() with hardirqs disabled (as PS1 did), then a call to
irqs_disabled() is still needed in irq_fpu_usable().  To avoid irqs_disabled()
entirely, we'd need to avoid disabling softirqs, which would mean supporting
nested kernel-mode FPU in softirqs.  I can sent out a patch that does that using
a per-CPU buffer, if you'd like to see that.  I wasn't super happy with the
extra edge cases and memory usage, but we could go in that direction.
