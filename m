I assume the reason is that you have very high security requirements.

If so, replacing PRNGs with something hardware-based may be a
reasonable idea. However, that does not seem entirely clear, given
that well-implemented & well-seeded PRNGs have been shown to
be adequate for crypto purposes, e.g. in Schneier et al's Yarrow
paper.

Yes, putting a mixer in front of an HRNG is almost always a good idea.
Since Linux has a built-in mixer, you might as well use that.

Far better, I'd say to arrange for the chip to reseed the random(4) driver.

If you really don't want to ever use any CRNG, then either remove the
/dev/urandom interface or make it a link to /dev/random. I do not
think that is either necessary or a good idea, but it is possible & does
not require messing with the kernel.

I'd say using almost anything as your sole entropy source would be
a serious error if security requirements are high. You want at least
two sources both because that leaves you safe if one fails and
because, even if someone discovers some flaw that makes it easy
to attack one source, the presence of the other makes the attack
extremely difficult.

The random(4) driver does collect entropy from interrupts etc.
and, depending on what your machine will be doing, that may
well be all the second source you need.

If you have RDRAND, that would be a fine second source. If
your board has an unused sound card equivalent, then
Denker's Turbid would be another. I'd use either or both if
available.
