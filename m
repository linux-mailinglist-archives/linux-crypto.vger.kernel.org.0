OK, so you are using that the dm-crypt user space tools will only
allow eboiv to be instantiated in combination with cbc(aes)? If so, do
you have a problem with patch #1 as well, which just double checks
that at the kernel level. With that patch applied, we can at least
avoid having to support every combination imaginable forever, while
the discussion takes place.

In any case, if performance does not really matter, restricting
ourselves to CBC mode has the beneficial side effect that the same tfm
used for decrypting the data could be used to encrypt the IV, and you
don't need to instantiate another cipher at all. On most systems,
cbc(aes) will be provided by a time invariant driver, and even if it
is costly to invoke this in some cases, it will at least not create
any security holes.
