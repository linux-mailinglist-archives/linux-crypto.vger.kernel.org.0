As it turns out, static calls are a poor fit for this. Imagine an interface like

poly1305_init(state)
poly1305_update(state, input)
poly1305_fina(state, digest)

which can be implemented by different libraries. The problem is that
state is opaque, and so it is generally not guaranteed that a sequence
that was started using one implementation can be completed using
another one.

Since the whole point is having a simple library interface,
complicating this with RCU hooks or other crazy plumbing to ensure
that no calls are in progress when you switch one out for another one,
I don't think static calls are suitable for this use case.

My goal here is to allow the generic library to be loaded with or
without the arch code, with the arch code always being used when it is
loaded. This is what I implemented using weak references, but it
requires a tweak in the module loader (two lines but not pretty).
Using weak references preserves the dependency order, since the
generic module will depend on the arch module (and up the refcount) it
any of its weak references were fulfilled by the arch module in
question. Using static calls will invert the dependency relation,
since the arch code will need to perform a static_call_update() to
make [users of] the generic library point to its code. How this works
with managing the module refcounts and unload order is an open
question afaict.

Yes. that is the whole point.

Agreed.

I have disregarded static calls and weak references for the time
being, and I will proceed with an implementation that uses neither.
The downside of this is that, e.g., we are forced to load the NEON
module on non-NEON capable hardware without calling any of its code,
but this is basically the Zinc situation only with the NEON and the
generic code living in different modules.
