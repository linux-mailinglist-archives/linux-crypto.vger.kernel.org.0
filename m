This looks a lot nicer!

However, I do have one little issue with the error case.  I think
we should not lump all errors together.  For queueing errors, we
should requeue regardless of MAY_BACKLOG.  After all, we don't
want to have random packet loss just becayse the queue was full.

For other errors (e.g., a kmalloc error), we should requeue the
MAY_BACKLOG requests and drop everythin else.

Thanks,
