If the system is already in a low memory situation a lot of things will
hang. Switching the compressor is not a common operation at all and we
shouldn't really worry about that. Even if we remove the acomp_ctx
allocation, we still need to make some allocations in that path anyway.

But we have to either allocate more memory unnecessarily or add config
options and make batching a build-time decision. This is unwarranted
imo.

FWIW, the mutexes and buffers used to be per-CPU not per-acomp_ctx, but
they were changed in commit 8ba2f844f050 ("mm/zswap: change per-cpu
mutex and buffer to per-acomp_ctx"). What you're suggesting is not quite
the same as what we had before that commit, it's moving the acomp_ctx
itself to be per-CPU but not per-pool, including the mtuex and buffer.
But I thought the context may be useful.

We should avoid making batching a build time decision if we can help it.
A lot of kernels are shipped to different hardware that may or may not
support batching, so users will have to either decide to turn off
batching completely or eat the overhead even for hardware that does not
support batching (or for users that use SW compression).

I think the concern here is unfounded. We shouldn't care about the
performance of zswap compressor switching, especially under memory
pressure. A lot of things will slow down under memory pressure, and
compressor switching should be the least of our concerns.
