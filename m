Oh, I see.  Currently the fuzz tests assume that if encryption fails with an
error (such as EINVAL), then decryption fails with that same error.

Regardless of what we think the correct decryption error is, running the
decryption test at all in this case is sort of broken, since the ciphertext
buffer was never initialized.  So for now we probably should just sidestep this
issue by skipping the decryption test if encryption failed, like this:

diff --git a/crypto/testmgr.c b/crypto/testmgr.c
index 96e5923889b9c1..0413bdad9f6974 100644

 	}
 	err = 0;

I'm planning to (at some point) update the AEAD tests to intentionally generate
some inauthentic inputs, but that will take some more work.
