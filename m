I think we decided that .arch_extension was too new to be used for
things like the crypto stuff where we still support older toolchains?

We do loose the checking that the assembler does that nobody used a
newer feature by mistake but yeah, shouldn't affect the output.

FWIW I did something different to this for BTI so I wasn't using the
instructions directly so I was going to abandon this series.
