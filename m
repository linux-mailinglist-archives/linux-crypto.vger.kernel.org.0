I would like to understand what people are actually going to do with
this.  Give me a user story or two, please.  If it turns out to be
useless, I would rather not merge it.

My concern has nothing to do with your patches per se.

I want to understand the entire workflow that makes Key Locker safer
than not using Key Locker.  Something like:

Step 1: Computer is powered on.
Step 2: Boot loader loads Linux
Step 3: Linux does such-and-such
Step 4: Attacker compromises the computer in the following way

and an explanation of why this is realistic and how Key Locker helps
would be nice.

I read that series.  This is not a good solution.

I can think of at least a few reasonable ways that a host and a guest
can cooperate to, potentially, make KL useful.

a) Host knows that the guest will never migrate, and guest delegates
IWKEY management to the host.  The host generates a random key and does
not permit the guest to use LOADIWKEY.  The guest shares the random key
with the host.  Of course, this means that a host key handle that leaks
to a guest can be used within the guest.

b) Host may migrate the guest.  Guest delegates IWKEY management to the
host, and the host generates and remembers a key for the guest.  On
migration, the host forwards the key to the new host.  The host can
still internally any type of key, but context switches may be quite slow.

c) Guest wants to manage its own non-random key.  Host lets it and
context switches it.

d) Guest does not need KL and leaves CR4.KL clear.  Host does whatever
it wants with no overhead.

All of these have tradeoffs.

My current thought is that, if Linux is going to support Key Locker,
then this all needs to be explicitly controlled.  On initial boot, Linux
should not initialize Key Locker.  Upon explicit administrator request
(via sysfs?), Linux will initialize Key Locker in the mode requested by
the administrator.  Modes could include:

native_random_key: Use a random key per the ISA.

native_kernel_key_remember: Use a random key but load it as a non-random
key.  Remember the key in kernel memory and use it for S3 resume, etc.

native_kernel_key_backup: Use a random key, put it in the backup
storage, and forget it.  Use the backup for resume, etc.

native_kernel_key_norestore: Use a random key.  The key is lost on any
power transition that forgets the key.  Backup is not used.

paravirt_any: Ask the hypervisor to handle keying.  Any mechanism is
acceptable.

paravirt_random: Ask the hypervisor for a random key.  Only succeeds if
we get an actual random key.



Does this make sense?
