Thanks for working on this. By wiring up the accelerated primitives,
you're essentially implementing Zinc, and I expect that by the end of
this, we'll wind up with something pretty close to where I started, with
the critical difference that the directory names are different. Despite
my initial email about WireGuard moving to the crypto API, it sounds
like in the end it is likely to stay with Zinc, just without that name.
