Who says that we need a separate SGL entry for the AAD?

I do not see the requirement that the caller must have at least two SGL 
entries.

In fact, for the AF_ALG interface, af_alg_get_rsgl creates the destination SGL 
and creates one SGL entry per user-space IOVEC. If user space provides a 
linear buffer with one IOVEC holding the AAD, CT, Tag, only one SGL entry is 
created.

For the source SGL, af_alg_sendmsg tries to be efficient to put as much as 
possible into one page referenced by one SGL entry. So, if user space provides 
AAD||PT which is less than a page in size, you get one SGL entry for the 
entire input data.

Well, the cipher implementation must be capable of processing any SGL 
structure. It is not given that the SGL with the source data has exactly 2 
entries. It can have one entry with AAD||PT. It can have two entries where the 
split is between AAD and PT. But it can have 2 entries where the split is in 
the middle of, say, AAD. Or it can have more SGL entries.

Please do not mix up the structure of the data to be contained in the SGL 
(say, AAD||PT) with the physical memory structure (e.g. how many SGL entries 
there are).

 Which, in my world, implies that the *other* scatterlist does NOT
