I don't understand how it can be worse than your existing patch.

I'm suggesting that you start with your current estimate, and only
fallback to allocating a bigger buffer in case that overflows.  So
it should be exactly the same as your current patch as the fallback
path would only activate in cases where your patch would have failed
anyway.

Once we start imposing arbitrary limits in the driver, then users
will forever be burdened with this.  So that's why I want to avoid
adding such limits.

The whole point of having this feature in the acomp API is to avoid
having users such as ipcomp preallocate huge buffers for the unlikely
case of an exceptionally large decompressed result.
