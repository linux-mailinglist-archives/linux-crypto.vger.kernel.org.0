Probably another issue with my driver, but just in case -
include/crypot/aead.h says:

 * The scatter list pointing to the input data must contain:
 *
 * * for RFC4106 ciphers, the concatenation of
 *   associated authentication data || IV || plaintext or ciphertext. Note,=
 the
 *   same IV (buffer) is also set with the aead_request_set_crypt call. Not=
e,
 *   the API call of aead_request_set_ad must provide the length of the AAD=
 and
 *   the IV. The API call of aead_request_set_crypt only points to the size=
 of
 *   the input plaintext or ciphertext.

I seem to be missing the place where this is handled in
generate_random_aead_testvec()
and generate_aead_message()

We seem to be generating a random IV for providing as the parameter to
aead_request_set_crypt()
but than have other random bytes set in aead_request_set_ad() - or am
I'm missing something again?

My apologies if this is just me suffering from lack of coffee...

Thanks!
