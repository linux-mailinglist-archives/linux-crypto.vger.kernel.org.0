Thanks.

It's not clear that that sse2 code is even faster than the x86_64
scalar code in the new implementation, actually. Either way,
regardless of that, in spite of the previous sentence, I don't think
it really matters, based on the chips we care about targeting.

You saw this code well over a year ago and seemed okay with it at the
time. Meanwhile you were inspired to fix your ChaCha implementation to
narrow the gap, but no progress with your Poly1305 one. And I'd like
to avoid adding a NEW implementation to audit for bugs and
vulnerabilities and stuff. On the contrary, this code here is in
widespread use and has been highly scrutinized. So please, don't waste
time doing such a thing. I'd nack it on the grounds of it being an
unnecessary risk.

Ard just added the same for the new Poly1305 implementations on ARM,
ARM64, MIPS, and MIPS64. This is code that's seen the most possible
eyeballs of code in this category. And now we're finally converging on
a complete set for that, with x86_64 being the last holdout. Please
don't hinder its adoption. Your old code is slow and hasn't received
much scrutiny. This new code is fast and has received a lot of
scrutiny.

Jason
