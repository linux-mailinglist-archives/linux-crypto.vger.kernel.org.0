Check the section it is defined in - it is only defined for the RVA22U64
profile which describes "features available to user-mode execution
environments". It otherwise has no meaning, so it is not suitable for
detecting anything from within the kernel. For other operating systems
it might actually mean something, but for Linux the uABI on RISC-V
unconditionally provides what Zicclsm is intended to convey:
https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/next/riscv/uabi.html#misaligned-accesses
We could (_perhaps_) set it in /proc/cpuinfo in riscv,isa there - but a
conversation would have to be had about what these non-extension
"features" actually are & whether it makes sense to put them there.

It actually means something, so it is certainly better ;)
I think checking it makes sense as a good surrogate for actually knowing
whether or not the hardware supports misaligned access.

The RISC-V kernel only supports LE at the moment. I hope that doesn't
change tbh.
