Yes. How can this code be both part of GnuMP *and* be heavily based on
it, but with changes?

Please avoid making changes to the original header, just add the SPDX
header in front, and add a clear justification in the commit log where
the file came from (preferably including git url and commit ID), and
what you based your assertion on that its license is compatible with
GPLv2.

Ideally, you would import the file *exactly* as it appears in the
upstream in one patch (with the above justification), and apply any
necessary changes in a subsequent patch, so it's  crystal clear that
we are complying with the original license.
