As I understand it, it is highly unusual for these code paths to be
exercised in the first place. All mac80211 hardware anyone still cares
about supports CCMP offload, and so only in special cases like Ben's
do we need the software implementation. Also, in Ben's case, it is on
a hot path whereas obsolete hardware that does not implement CCMP
offload does not support anything over 11g speeds to begin with.

Then, there is the additional issue where the FPU preserve/restore
appears to be disproportionately expensive on the actual SoC in
question.

My preferred approach for cbcmac(aes-ni) would be to mirror the arm64
exactly, which means going through the data only a single time, and
interleave the CTR and CBCMAC operations at the AES round level. My
cbcmac ahash approach (v2) is plan B as far as I am concerned, but it
turns out to be flawed and I haven't had time to look into this.

But if we look at the actual issue at hand, we might also look into
amortizing the FPU preserve/restore over multiple invocations of a
cipher. I proposed a patch a while ago that makes cipher an internal
crypto API abstraction, and we could easily add pre/post hooks that
preserve/restore the FPU in this case, in which case we would not need
any changes at higher levels.
