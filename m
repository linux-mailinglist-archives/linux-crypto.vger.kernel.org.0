How long is this up-to-91% in seconds?  If it's 91% of a millisecond
then not impressed.  If it's 91% of two weeks then better :)

Relatedly, how important is boot time on these large machines anyway? 
They presumably have lengthy uptimes so boot time is relatively
unimportant?

IOW, can you please explain more fully why this patchset is valuable to
our users?
