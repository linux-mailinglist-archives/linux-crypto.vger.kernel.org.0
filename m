I don't think this makes sense.  TX is typically done in response
to RX so the natural alignment is for it to be on the same CPU.

This sounds pretty tenuous.  In any case, even if wireless itself
doesn't get you, there could be loads running on top of it, for
example, IPsec.

We already have a framework for acceleration that works properly
in aesni, I don't want to see us introduce another broken model
within the same driver.

So either just leave the whole thing along or do it properly by
making wireless async.
