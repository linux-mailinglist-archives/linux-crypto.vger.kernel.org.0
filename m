I agree that the current approach is flawed, but starting multiple
requests with the same state essentially comes down to IV reuse in a
stream cipher, which will cause it to fail catastrophically.
(ciphertext1 ^ ciphertext2 == plaintext1 ^ plaintext2)

I wonder if we should simply try to get rid of arc4 in the crypto API,
as you suggested. There are a couple of WEP implementations that could
be switched over to the library interface, and the KerberosV
implementation of RC4-HMAC(md5) was added for Windows 2000
compatibility based on RFC 4757 [0], which was deprecated by RFC 8429
[1], since Windows Domain Controllers running Windows Server 2008r2 or
later can use newer algorithms.

I agree that there is a gap here.

Perhaps we can decouple ARC4 from the other cases? ARC4 is too quirky
and irrelevant to model this on top of, I think.
