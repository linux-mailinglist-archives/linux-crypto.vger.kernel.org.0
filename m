Clearly NTLM (NTLMv1) should be disabled by default, despite the fact
that some old appliances use it - but it already is disabled by
default (and disabling its dependencies by default are fine too as
long as it doesn't break NTLMSSP with current dialects)

Rearranging the code similar to what Ronnie's patches do so we can
configure without SMB1 - and don't enable SMB1 and any algorithms
needed by SMB1 is fine, but SMB1 is still surprisingly broadly
deployed.   But ... we may want to consider building the default with
the name "smb3.ko" (with SMB1 disabled), since mount can now do "mount
-t smb3 ..." to make it more clear that what you are mounting is safe
- but I worry less about this since a user has to make an explicit
choice on mount "vers=1.0" to mount with SMB1 ("CIFS" dialect) - the
defaults give you SMB2.1 or later (usually will negotiate SMB3.1.1).
SMB2 and SMB1 have to be explicitly requested on mount to work so the
risk is low in using them.

But, the question about removing things needed by NTLMSSP/NTLMv2 is
harder as probably the majority of machines would default to this
(huge number of Macs, iPhones, iPads, Windows systems, Samba Linux,
smb tools etc) - these are hundreds of millions of machines that can
support Kerberos but are usually setup to negotiate NTLMSSP/NTLMv2.
If we want to move forward with disabling things needed by NTLMSSP for
current systems (SMB3, SMB3.1.1 etc) then we STRONGLY need to
implement a "peer to peer" authentication choice ASAP on Linux.
Currently Windows systems will use PKU2U (see e.g.
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-zhu-pku2u/) and Macs have a
peer to peer Kerberos that they support IIRC.

Defaulting to Kerberos would be fine ... if ... we also had a peer to
peer mechanism (e.g. PKU2U) implemented to add to the defaults that
are negotiated in SPNEGO by the Linux client.
