As I said already: small patches that add pre-operational self-tests
would generally be fine, if they are shown to actually be needed and are
narrowly scoped to what is actually needed.  Is that what you're asking
about?  If not, please be specific about what you're asking about.

That submission is an entirely different topic.  Obviously, a 100+ patch
series that re-architects the kernel is going to be more controversial
in the community than a patch that just adds a bit of logic, such as a
self-test, under 'if (fips_enabled)'.  But that is a different topic,
and it's unrelated to the current approach to FIPS that is (sort of)
supported by the upstream kernel.  If you would like to comment on that
patch series, perhaps you should respond to that thread and not some
unrelated thread?  This thread is supposed to be about SHAKE256 support.
