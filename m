Agreed.

But we came to this point in response to your assertion that a
userland application can only make meaningful use of the hardware
accelerator if it uses some kind of asynchronous API like AIO, and I
tried to explain that this is not the case.

Of course. But what appears on the actual hot path is a single 'cbz'
instruction that is always predicted correctly, and the actual code
lives somewhere else in the binary. That is why I said *memory*
footprint not *cache* footprint, since it only affects the former and
not the latter.

Fair enough. But I did understand correctly that this was a deliberate

RIght. So how does this this relate to your remark above that working
workarounds prevent issues from being known to the h/w guys?

I'll ignore the remark about boundedness since it has no bearing
whatsoever on this discussion.

As for compliance, many of the zero length test vectors were sourced
from FIPS or NIST documents, so i don't care what you call it, but it
is a perfectly reasonable requirement that new implementations work as
expected for test vectors that have been published along with the
algorithm.

Again, I am not saying your hardware should do this. I am only saying
that, from a software engineering perspective, your driver is where we
fix up the differences, not anywhere else.

True. So again, if you choose to support your hardware as part of a
subsystem that does not have these requirements, I am perfectly fine
with that.

Negligible

Yes, but again, this complexity has to live *somewhere*, and we don't
want it in the generic code.

So what exactly are you proposing? Mind you, we cannot optimize this
away, so we will have to add checks /somewhere/ that we are not
calling into the crypto code with length values it doesn't support.
