There's still a command-line option cryptomgr.noslowtests=1.

If you really want it, we could add back a kconfig option to control whether the
self-tests run the "fast" tests only or not.  I thought that the only use case
for running the "fast" tests only was for people who are misusing these tests
for FIPS pre-operational self-testing.  (Which has always been a poor match, as
FIPS requires only a single test of any length per algorithm, for only a subset
of algorithms.  It's totally different from actually doing proper testing.)
Those people should be okay with the command-line option.

I do think the idea of running the tests in production kernels is questionable.
There are enough tests now that you can't run all of them (and indeed you are
not asking for that), which means the production testing will be incomplete, and
the real testing needs to be done in the development phase with a build that has
the tests enabled anyway.  The same applies to other kernel subsystems too.
