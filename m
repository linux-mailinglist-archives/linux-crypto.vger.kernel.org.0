The problem with a virtio device is that it is a ... device. What we 
want
is to be able to have access to an entropy source extremely early in 
the
kernel life, and devices tend to be available pretty late in the game.
This means we cannot plug them in the architectural helpers that Ard
mentions above.

What you're suggesting looks more like a new kind of virtio transport,
which is interesting, in a remarkably twisted way... ;-)

Thanks,
