I'm almost ready to give my Reviewed-by for this whole series.  The problem is
that it can't be merged until its prerequisites are merged.

Andy Chiu's last patchset "riscv: support kernel-mode Vector" was 2 months ago,
but he also gave a talk at Plumbers about it more recently
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eht3PccEn5o).  So I assume he's still working
on it.  It sounds like he's also going to include support for preemption, and
optimizations to memcpy, memset, memmove, and copy_{to,from}_user.

I think it would be a good idea to split out the basic support for
kernel_vector_{begin,end} so that the users of them, as well as the preemption
support, can be considered and merged separately.  Maybe patch 1 of the series
(https://lore.kernel.org/r/20231019154552.23351-2-andy.chiu@sifive.com) is all
that's needed initially?

Andy, what do you think?
