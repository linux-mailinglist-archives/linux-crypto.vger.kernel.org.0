Yes, correct. That's why I had no real objection to using it :-)

At first I was confused and I thought this new library interface was
"the preferred way" for using chacha20poly1305, therefore I went down
this path.

Alright.

oops, I was not up-to-date. Thanks again!
We'll definitely look into this soon.
