Please don't misunderstand, I don't blame you at all.  I was in favor of ARC4 
removal since the kernel AF_ALG implementation was broken and the ell 
implementation had to work around that.  And you went the extra mile to make 
sure the migration was smooth.  The reported bug is still a fairly minor 
inconvenience in the grand scheme of things.

But, I'm not in favor of doing the same for MD4...

That is not something that iwd has any control over though?  We have to support 
it for as long as there are  organizations using TTLS + MD5 or PEAPv0.  There 
are still surprisingly many today.
