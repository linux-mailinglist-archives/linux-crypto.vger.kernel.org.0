I think Pavel added that functionality, maybe he could confirm.

My impression was that the reason deferred_grow_zone aligned the requested
order up to a section was to make enough memory available to avoid being called
on every allocation.

I may not be following your question, but deferred_grow_zone doesn't allocate
memory during the multithreading in deferred_init_memmap because the latter
sets first_deferred_pfn so that deferred_grow_zone bails early.

deferred_grow_zone remains singlethreaded.  It could stop in the middle of a
max order block, but it can't run concurrently with deferred_init_memmap, as
per above, so if deferred_init_memmap were to init 'n free the remaining part
of the block, the previous portion would have already been initialized.
