Sorry, I don't mean to be confusing, but I clearly haven't written
very well. There are two things being discussed here, 32-bit and
64-bit, rather than just one. Let me clarify:

- The motivation for the 64-bit version is primarily performance. Its
performance isn't really in dispute. It's significant and good. I'll
put this in the commit message of the next series I send out.

- The motivation for the 32-bit version is primarily to have code that
can be compared line by line to the 64-bit version, in order to make
auditing easier given the situation with two implementations and also
for general cleanliness. I think there's enormous value in having the
other implementation be "parallel". Rather than two totally different
and foreign implementations, we have two related and comparable ones.
That's a good thing.  As a *side note*, it might also be slightly
faster than the one it replaces, which is great and all I guess, but
not the primary motivation of the 32-bit version.

Does that make sense? That's why I appear to simultaneously be arguing
that performance matters and doesn't matter. The motivation for the
64-bit version is performance. The motivation for the 32-bit version
is cleanliness. Two things, which are related.

I'll make this clear in the commit message of the next series I send.
Sorry again for being confusing.

Jason
