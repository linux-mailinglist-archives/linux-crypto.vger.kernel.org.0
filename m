While it would be very useful to be able to test every single function
in the kernel, there are limitations imposed by our approach.
To work around these limitations, some code may need to be refactored
for better testability, so that global state can be mocked out or
easily reset between runs.

I am not very familiar with the code in
cfg80211_inform_bss_frame_data(), but I can imagine that the code
doing the actual frame parsing could be untangled from the code that
registers it in the global list.
The upside of doing so would be the ability to test that parsing logic
in modes that real-world syscall invocations may never exercise.

This approach is quite popular among security researchers, but if I'm
understanding correctly, we are yet to see continuous integration of
UML-based fuzzers with the kernel development process.

From our experience, accumulated state is more of a disadvantage that
we'd rather eliminate altogether.
syzkaller can chain syscalls and could in theory generate a single
program that is elaborate enough to prepare the state and then find an
issue.
However, because resetting the kernel (rebooting machines or restoring
VM snapshots) is costly, we have to run multiple programs on the same
kernel instance, which interfere with each other.
As a result, some bugs that are tricky to trigger become even trickier
to reproduce, because one can't possibly replay all the interleavings
of those programs.

So, yes, assuming we can build the kernel with ARCH=3Dum and run the
function under test in a fork-per-run model, that would speed things
up significantly.

I looked at UML myself around 2023, and back then my impression was
that it didn't quite work with KASAN and KCOV, and adding an AFL
dependency on top of that made every fuzzer a one-of-a-kind setup.

We did consider such a model, but decided against it, with the
maintainability of the fuzzers being the main reason.
We want to be sure that every fuzz target written for the kernel is
still buildable when the code author turns back on it.
We also want every target to be tested continuously and for the bugs
to be reported automatically.
Coming from the syzkaller side, it was natural to use the existing
infrastructure for that instead of reinventing the wheel :)

That being said, our current approach doesn't rule out UML.
In the future, we could adapt the FUZZ_TEST macro to generate stubs
that link against AFL, libFuzzer, or Centipede in UML builds.
The question of how to run those targets continuously would still be
on the table, though.
