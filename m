The reason we return output IVs for CBC is because our generic
implementation of CTS can wrap any CBC implementation, and relies on
this output IV rather than grabbing it from the ciphertext directly
(which may be tricky and is best left up to the CBC code)

For CTS itself, as well as XTS, returning an output IV is meaningless,
given that
a) the implementations rely on the skcipher_walk infrastructure to
present all input except the last bit in chunks that are a multiple of
the block size,
b) neither specification defines how chaining of inputs should work,
regardless of whether the preceding input was a multiple of the block
size or not.

The CS3 mode that we implement for CTS swaps the final two blocks
unconditionally. So even if the input is a whole multiple of the block
size, the preceding ciphertext will turn out differently if any output
happens to follow.

For XTS, the IV is encrypted before processing the first block, so
even if you do return an output IV, the subsequent invocations of the
skcipher need to omit the encryption, which we don't implement
currently.

So if you are saying that we should never split up algif_skcipher
requests into multiple calls into the underlying skcipher, then I
agree with you. Even if the generic CTS seems to work more or less as
expected by, e.g., the NIST validation tool, this is unspecified
behavior, and definitely broken in various other places.
