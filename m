Indeed this belongs in the Makefile. I can send a patch adjusting
that, if you want, but I think I'd rather do nothing and have a fix be
rolled out in 10.0.1. Clang users should know what to expect in that
regard.

That might be the most coherent thing to do, at least so that people
don't get some false sense of mitigation.
