OK

Yes, but your code is faster than the existing code for 1420 byte
packets, right? So why should we keep the original code? We don't use
GCM for block storage, and if IPsec throughput is a key performance
metric for your system, you are likely to be using the maximum packet
size so 1420 bytes not 1k.
