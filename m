Table based AES is known to be vulnerable to plaintext attacks on the
key, since each byte of the input xor'ed with the key is used as an
index for doing Sbox lookups, and so with enough samples, there is an
exploitable statistical correlation between the response time and the
key.

So in the context of EBOIV, where the user might specify a SIMD based
time invariant skcipher, it would be really bad if the known plaintext
encryptions of the byte offsets that occur with the *same* key would
happen with a different cipher that is allocated implicitly and ends
up being fulfilled by, e.g., aes-generic, since in that case, each
block en/decryption is preceded by a single, time-variant AES
invocation with an easily guessable input.

In your case, we are not dealing with known plaintext attacks, and the
higher latency of h/w accelerated crypto makes me less worried that
the final, user observable latency would strongly correlate the way
aes-generic in isolation does.

Indeed. Note that for EBOIV, such performance concerns are deemed
irrelevant, but it is an issue in the general case.

We did some work to reduce the time variance of AES: there is the
aes-ti driver, and there is now also the AES library, which is known
to be slower than aes-generic, but does include some mitigations for
cache timing attacks.

Other than that, I have little to offer, given that the performance vs
security tradeoffs were decided long before security became a thing
like it is today, and so removing aes-generic is not an option,
especially since the scalar alternatives we have are not truly time
invariant either.
