Oh, definitely. The number of issue these tests found...

The padding character '=' wasn't handled correctly on decoding (the 
character itself was skipped, by the 'bits' value wasn't increased, 
leading to a spurious error in decoding an any key longer than 32 bit 
not being accepted.

Well, no, not really; the patch itself got squashed in the main patches.
But problem here was that the key transformation from section 8.13.5.7 
had been using the hash algorithm from the initial challenge, not the 
one specified in the key itself.
This lead to decoding errors when using a key with a different length 
than the hash algorithm.

Cheers,

Hannes
