Thanks a lot for your feedback. I tried a few of your ideas and it turns out,
that they work quite well. First of all, with a single-block aes
encrypt/decrypt in our hardware (CPACF), we're very close to the resolution of
our CPU clock.

Disclaimer: The encryption/decryption of one block takes ~32ns (~500MB/s).
These numbers should be taken with some care, as on s390 the operating system
always runs virtualized. In my test environment, I also only have access to a
machine with shared CPUs, so there might be some negative impact from other
workload.

The benchmark loops for 100 iterations now without any warm-up. In each
iteration, I measure a single aes_encrypt()/aes_decrypt() call. The lowest
value of these measurements is takes as the value for the bandwidth
calculations. Although it is not necessary in my environment, I'm doing all
iterations with preemption disabled. I think, that this might help on other
platforms to reduce the jitter of the measurement values.

The removal of the warm-up does not have any impact on the numbers.

Just for information: I also tried to measure the cycles with the same
results. The minimal measurement value of a few iterations is much more stable
that the average over a larger number of iterations.

I also did some tests with IRQs disabled (instead of only preemption), but the
numbers stay the same. So I think, it is save enough to stay with disables
preemption.

I also tried you idea, first to do a few measurements and if they are fast
enough, increase the number of iterations. But it turns out, that this it not
really necessary (at least in my env). But I can add this, it it makes sense
on other platforms.
