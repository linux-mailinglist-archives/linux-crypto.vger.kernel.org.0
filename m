So both 'err' and sg->length will contain the same error? In this case
why do we need to check if dlen < 0? Shouldn't checking 'err' be
sufficient? and it would work for both SW and HW and we wouldn't need
errp. Did I miss something?

I am not sure I understand what changes lie in the crypto layer and what
changes lie in the SW compressors. I am not suggesting we do any
modification to the SW compressors.

I imagined that the crypto layer would present a uniform API regardless
of whether or not the compressor supports batching. Ideally zswap would
pass in a batch to crypto and it would figure out if it needs to break
them down or not. Then the output length and errors would be presented
uniformly to the caller.

That being said, I am not at all familiar with how crypto works and how
straightforward that would be. Herbert, WDYT?

It would be even nicer if the batches are also abstracted by SG lists.

Also, I don't like how the error codes and output lengths are presented
differently for HW and SW compressors.
