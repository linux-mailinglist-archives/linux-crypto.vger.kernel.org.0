Correct (for entropy + nonce + pers), I thought you were referring to
just the entropy + nonce part. This change is not needed for FIPS of
course but I changed it too to use the same algorithm and lengths as
when Jitter RNG is available.

Do you prefer to keep the current lengths (384 bits) when there is no
Jitter RNG? It seems to me that this change makes sense and could only
strengthen this case though.

OK, it is just a misunderstanding of what is where. To simplify the code
(with a fixed-length entropy array) I used the "entropy" array to store
the entropy + nonce + the automatically generated personalization string
or additional input. The user-supplied personalization string or
additional input is stored (unchanged) in the pers drbg_string. I
(briefly) explained this in the comments.

Another difference brought by this change is that the Jitter RNG data
(i.e. entropy source) is used at the beginning (of the entropy array)
and the urandom data (i.e. random source) at the end. This strictly
follows the algorithm described in SP800-90Ar1 sections 8.6.1, 8.6.2,
10.1.1.2 and 10.1.1.3 .

What is the rational of using 384 (strength * 1.5) bits to draw from
get_random_bytes?

We noticed that (as explained above) the order of these sources doesn't
follows SP800-90Ar1.
It is not clear which part and source is used for the entropy, nonce and
(maybe) personalization string.
If the random source is indeed the personalization string or the
additional input, then the pers length may not fit with the maximum
lengths specified in SP800-90Ar1 table 2 and 3.

It just fits with strength/2 for the length of the nonce.

Right, but the intent here is to strictly follow SP800-90Ar1 (hence the
use of Jitter RNG for entropy and nonce) but to still use the urandom
source, which seems to only fit in the personalization string according
to SP800-90Ar1.

Agreed, the user-supplied personalization string can be used to add more
data. We also want to harden the default use (i.e. without user-provided
personalization string) by automatically using non-entropy source
(urandom) though.

   ^                              ^
   personalization string?        entropy+nonce

As described in SP800-90Ar1 section 10.1.1.2:
seed_material = entropy_input || nonce || personalization_string

As described in SP800-90Ar1 section 10.1.1.3:
seed_material = 0x01 || V || entropy_input || additional_input

And SP800-90Ar1 section 5 defining "X || Y" as "Concatenation of two
strings X and Y. X and Y are either both bitstrings, or both byte strings".

According to that, we would like at least:
<384 bits Jitter RNG> || <256 bits get_random_bytes>
and also enforcing the maximum length for the whole personalization
string and the additional input.

Thanks,
 Mickaël
