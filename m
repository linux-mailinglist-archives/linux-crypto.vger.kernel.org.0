Either the delay is not relevant, in which case we should entirely
remove `add_early_randomness()`, or the delay is relevant, in which case
hw_random should use the right function, so that it gets credited as it
should. (Semantically this is the right thing to do, too, so that
random.c can actually know what the deal is with the data it's getting;
knowing, "oh this comes from hw_random" could be useful.)

It is, yes, thanks. The concern is that now it means random.c can't ask
for more hw_random data by canceling that sleep. I was thinking that it
would be nice to cancel the sleep during system resume, vm fork, and
other similar events, so that we can get some fresh bits during the
times it matters most. But there's a bit of a problem of doing it in a
basic way like that: we might get the bits, but that doesn't mean we'll
reseed right away at that advanced stage in uptime. So we'd actually
need something more complicated like, "unblock from sleep now and reseed
after mixing data". When writing this patch last night, I was thinking
this is a more complicated thing that could benefit from a more
complicated API. But actually, maybe there's a way I can make it work
for the existing thing. So you're right: let's hold off on this v2. And
I'll send a v3 that just adds a boolean parameter of whether or not to
sleep. And then I'll also try tackling the unblock&reseed thing too at
the same time.

Jason
