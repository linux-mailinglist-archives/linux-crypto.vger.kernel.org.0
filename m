That is recent and there's at least 1 person I recognize as having
proper expertise in this matter ;-)

Another problem (IMO) is that a lot (?) of people (like myself) don't
(really) understand crypto and therefor rely on the description in the
Kconfig help text and make a choice based on that.
That's (one of) the reason(s) I was so happy with the clear text :-)

Only speaking for myself, my *assumption* is that crypto functionality
in hardware is/should be faster and would lessen the load on the CPU
(which with several SBCs seems really worthwhile).
But I don't have the knowledge to determine whether it's broken or not.
Unless there's a(n easy) tool for that (like 'rngtest' [1]).

[1] https://lore.kernel.org/linux-rockchip/6425788.NZdkxuyfQg@bagend/
resulting in f.e.
5afdb98dcc55 ("arm64: dts: rockchip: Describe why is HWRNG disabled in RK35=
6x base dtsi")

Thanks for the additional info :-)
