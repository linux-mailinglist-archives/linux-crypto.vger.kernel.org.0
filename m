Thanks!

As I pointed out in the private discussions we had, there are two
aspects two AndyP's benchmarking that don't carry over 100% to the
Linux kernel:
- Every microarchitecture is given equal weight, regardless of the
likelihood that the code will actually run on it. This makes some
sense for OpenSSL, I guess, but not for the kernel.
- Benchmarks are typically based on the performance of the core
cryptographics transformation rather than a representative workload.
This is especially relevant for network use cases, where packet sizes
are not necessarily fixed and usually not a multiple of the block size
(as opposed to disk encryption, where every single call is the same
size and a power of 2)

So for future changes, could we please include performance numbers
based on realistic workloads?

My concern here (but we can discuss it in the context of a repost) is
that this will pull the accelerated chacha20 and poly1305 code (if
enabled)  into the core kernel, given that big_keys is not a tristate
option. So perhaps we can park this one until we know how to proceed
with static calls or alternative approaches?

I'm a bit surprised that this only appears at the end of your list :-)

We're at -rc8, and wireguard itself will not go via the crypto tree so
you should wait until after the merge window, rebase it onto -rc1 and
repost it.
