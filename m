Although this makes sense the problem is that changing applications to
do the right thing based on which situation they are in will never be
done right or soon enough. So I would focus on a solution that makes
the CSPRNGs in crypto libraries safe.

4c does sound like a decent solution, it is semantically identical to
an epoch vmgenid, all the library needs to do is to create such a mmap
region, stick a value on  it, verify it is not zero after computing the
next random value but before returning it to the caller.
This reduces the race to a very small window when the machine is frozen
right after the random value is returned to the caller but before it is
used, but hopefully this just means that the two machines will just
make parallel computations that yield the exact same value, so no
catastrophic consequence will arise (there is the odd case where two
random values are sought and the split happens between the two are
retrieved and this has bad consequences, I think we can ignore that).

I am not entirely sure how a vDSO RNG would work, I think exposing the
epoch(or whatever indicator) is enough, crypto libraries have pretty
good PRNGs, what they require is simply a good source of entropy for
the initial seeding and this safety mechanism to avoid state
duplication on machine cloning.
All the decent libraries already support detecting process forks.

Simo.
