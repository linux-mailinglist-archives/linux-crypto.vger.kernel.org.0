Hi Eric

We have a userspace program that starts pretty early in the boot process 
and it tries to fetch random bits from /dev/random with O_NONBLOCK, if 
that returns -EAGAIN, it turns to /dev/urandom. Is this a correct 
handling of -EAGAIN? Or this is not one of the intended use case of 
O_NONBLOCK?
