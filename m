The "interesting" thing about this is that given a key to which you have only
Search permission, you can request plaintext-ciphertext pairs with it using any
algorithm from the kernel's crypto API.  So if there are any really broken
algorithms and they happen to take the correct length key, you can effectively
read the key.  That's true even if you don't have Read permission on the key
and/or the key is of the "logon" type which doesn't have a ->read() method.

Since this is already also true for dm-crypt and maybe some other features in
the kernel, and there will be a new API for fscrypt that doesn't rely on "logon"
keys with Search access thus avoiding this problem and many others
(https://patchwork.kernel.org/cover/10951999/), I don't really care much whether
this patch is applied.  But I wonder whether this is something you've actually
considered, and what security properties you think you are achieving by using
the Linux keyrings.
