Now that's a much smaller and simpler and easier to understand change,
compared to "rewrite the whole random number generator".

Why not work to get FIPS support merged properly upstream?  I know there
are many people working to get FIPS certification, and while the
requirements seem to constantly change and are vague and random, it
would be great to stop duplicating all of this effort all the time.

Great, why not work to solve this within what we have?

Remember, wholesale replacement is NOT how kernel development happens.
It's incremental evolution based on external need.  It's not a "kill the
existing code and replace it from scratch" process.

Great, please work to make this happen within what we have today.

But adding a stand-alone separate random subsystem just for this is not
a good idea and is one huge reason why this patch set keeps being
ignored by the kernel developers.
