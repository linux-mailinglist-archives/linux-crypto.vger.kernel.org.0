Wouldn't it make a lot more sense to make skcipher algorithms non-chainable by
default, and only opt-in the ones where chaining is actually working?  At the
moment we only test iv_out for CBC and CTR, so we can expect that all the others
are broken.

Note that wide-block modes such as Adiantum don't support chaining either.

Also, please use a better name than "fcsize".
