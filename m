You are right.  I'll add these tests to the patch.

I think this is a different problem, one which we probably should
address but it already exists regardless of what we do here.  For
example, assuming that tmpl(X) does not currently exist, and I
request tmpl(X-generic) then tmpl(X-generic) along with X-generic
will be created in the system.  If someone then comes along and
asks for tmpl(X) then we'll simply give them tmpl(X-generic) even
if there exists an accelerated version of X.

The problem you describe is simply a racy version of the above
scenario where the requests for tmpl(X) and tmpl(X-generic) occur
about the same time.

We should certainly fix this, as otherwise anyone could force
the whole system to use the generic (or some other non-optimal
variant).  One possible solution is to mark any instance created
by a request like tmpl(X-generic) as non-optimal so that a subsequent
request for tmpl(X) has to go through the whole process again before
being fulfilled.

The hardest part of this is actually ensuring that X-generic does
not fulfil a subsequent request for X.  This is because X-generic
is probably going to be created by a module-load and the crypto
API is not driving the registration of X-generic.  We could
probably use some form of larvals that get created at registration
time to resolve this.

Cheers,

When CONFIG_CRYPTO_MANAGER_EXTRA_TESTS=y, the first lookup of an
algorithm that needs to be instantiated using a template will always get
the generic implementation, even when an accelerated one is available.

This happens because the extra self-tests for the accelerated
implementation allocate the generic implementation for comparison
purposes, and then crypto_alg_tested() for the generic implementation
"fulfills" the original request (i.e. sets crypto_larval::adult).

This patch fixes this by only fulfilling the original request if
we are currently the best outstanding larval as judged by the
priority.
