As I've explained before, I think your proposed approach is much too complex,
inefficient, and broken compared to my much simpler patchset
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-crypto/20241001153718.111665-1-ebiggers@kernel.org/.
If this is really going to be the API for multibuffer hashing, then I'm not very
interested in using or contributing to it.

The much larger positive diffstat in your patchset alone should speak for
itself, especially when it doesn't include essential pieces that were included
in my smaller patchset, such as self-tests, dm-verity and fs-verity support,
SHA-NI and ARMv8 CE support.  Note that due to the complexity of your API, it
would require far more updates to the tests in order to cover all the new edge
cases.  This patchset also removes the shash support for sha256-avx2, which is
not realistic, as there are still ~100 users of shash in the kernel.

You say that your API is needed so that users don't need to "spend extra effort
in order to accumulate and maintain multiple streams of data."  That's
incorrect, though.  The users, e.g. {dm,fs}-verity, will need to do that anyway
even with your API.  I think this would have been clear if you had tried to
update them to use your API.

With this patchset I am also seeing random crashes in the x86 sha256 glue code,
and all multibuffer SHA256 hashes come back as all-zeroes.  Bugs like this were
predictable, of course.  There's a high amount of complexity inherent in the
ahash request chaining approach, both at the API layer and in the per-algorithm
glue code.  It will be hard to get everything right.  And I am just submitting 8
equal-length requests, so I haven't even tried any of the edge cases that your
proposed API allows, like submitting requests that aren't synced up properly.

I don't think it's worth the time for me to try to debug and fix your code and
add the missing pieces, when we could just choose a much simpler design that
would result in far fewer bugs.  Especially for cryptographic code, choosing
sound designs that minimize the number of bugs should be the highest priority.

I understand that you're trying to contribute something useful, and perhaps
solve a wider set of problems than I set out to solve.  The reality, though, is
that this patchset is creating more problems than it's solving.  Compared to my
patchset, it makes things harder, more error-prone, and less efficient for the
users who actually want the multibuffer hashing, and likewise for wiring it up
to the low-level algorithms.  It also doesn't bring us meaningfully closer to
applying multibuffer crypto in other applications like IPsec where it will be
very difficult to apply, is irrelevant for the most common algorithm used, and
would at best provide less benefit than other easier-to-implement optimizations.

The virtual address to support in ahash is a somewhat nice addition, but it
could go in independently, and ultimately it seems not that useful, given that
users could just use shash or lib/crypto/ instead.  shash will still have less
overhead, and lib/crypto/ even less, despite ahash getting slightly better.
Also, users who actually care about old-school style crypto accelerators need
pages + async processing anyway for optimal performance, especially given this
patchset's proposed approach of handling virtual addresses using a bounce page.

If you're really interested in the AVX2 multibuffer SHA256 for some reason, I'd
be willing to clean up that assembly code and wire it up to the much simpler API
that I proposed.  Despite the favorable microbenchmark result, this would be of
limited use, for various reasons that I've explained before.  But it could be
done if desired, and it would be much simpler than what you have.
