Hi again :-)

So I've been spending another day on this, looking at kafl/nyx as
promised, and thinking about afl++ integration.

It's actually a bit more nuanced - it can work without Intel-PT using
instrumentation for feedback and using the upstream kvm PML APIs, but
then it requires the "vmware backdoor" enabled.

Also, the qemu they have is based on version 4.2, according to the bug
tracker there were two failed attempts at forward-porting it.

Or maybe not given the state of the kafl/nyx world... :)

I also just spent a bunch of time looking at integrating afl++ with kcov
and it seems ... tricky? There seem to be assumptions on the data format
in afl++, but the kcov data format is entirely different, both for block
and compare tracking. I think it could be made to work most easily by
first supporting -fsanitize-coverage=3Dtrace-pc-guard in kcov (which is
clang only at this point), and adding a new KCOV_TRACE_ mode for it, one
that indexes by guard pointer and assigns incrementing numbers to those
like afl does, or so?

I'd think it'd be useful to also be able to run afl++ on the kfuzztests
proposed here by forwarding the kcov data. For this though, it seems it
might also be useful to actually wait for remote kcov to finish? Yeah
there's still the whole state issue, but at least (remote) kcov will
only trace code that's actually relevant to the injected data. This
would be with afl running as a normal userspace process against the
kfuzztest of the kernel it's running in, but with some additional setup
it'd also be possible to apply it to UML with forking to avoid state
issues.

(And yes, kcov seems to work fine on UML.)

I guess I'll go play with this some unless someone sees total show-
stoppers.
