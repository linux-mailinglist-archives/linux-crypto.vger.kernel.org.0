Hmm. Okay. But after having read section 5.6.1.1.4, I still do have some
questions.

Assume we will be using a bit length of 512 for FFDHE, then we will
trivially pass Step 2 for all supported FFDHE groups (the maximum
symmetric-equivalent strength for ffdhe8192 is 192 bits).

From my understanding, the random number generator will fill out all
available bytes in the string (and nothing more), so we trivially
satisfy step 3 and 4.

And as q is always larger than the random number, step 6 reduces to
'if (c > 2^N - 2)', ie we just need to check if the random number is a
string of 0xff characters. Which hardly is a random number at all, so
it'll be impossible to get this.

Which then would mean that our 'x' is simply the random number + 1,
which arguably is slightly pointless (one more than a random number is
as random as the number itself), so I do feel justified with just
returning a random number here.

Am I wrong with that reasoning?

Cheers,

Hannes
