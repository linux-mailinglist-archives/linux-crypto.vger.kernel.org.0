Thanks for your explanation. Unfortunately this isn't my script. I'm
just a former BCM2835 maintainer and interested that more user stick to
the mainline kernel instead of the vendor ones. I will try to report the
script owner.

Now i agree that the provided example isn't the proper way to handle
/dev/urandom. Unfortunately most of the Raspberry Pi users doesn't care
about such details. In their eyes the mainline kernel is "broken" and
this is one argument to go back to the vendor ones.

Beside of the /dev/urandom abuse, i'm not convinced that sleeping for 1
sec is a good choice. This HRNG IP is used in embedded devices (e.g.
Router) and mostly without any other good source of entropy. So i think
it's worth to define a reasonable value.

Best regards
