Of course it's useful.  It means that *every* possible file has a SHA-256
digest.  So if you're validating a file, you just check the SHA-256 digest; or
if you're creating a manifest, you just hash the file and list the SHA-256
digest.  Making everyone handle empty files specially would be insane.

The standard attack model for MACs assumes the attacker can send an arbitrary
(message, MAC) pair.  Depending on the protocol there may be nothing preventing
them from sending an empty message, e.g. maybe it's just a file on the
filesystem which can be empty.  So it makes perfect sense for the HMAC of an
empty message to be defined so that it can be checked without a special case for
empty messages, and indeed the HMAC specification
(https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/publications/fips/198/1/final/documents/fips-198-1_final.pdf)
clearly says that 0 is an allowed input length.  Note that the algorithmic
description of HMAC handles this case naturally; indeed, it would be a special
case if 0 were *not* allowed.

Essentially the same applies for AEADs.

People can develop weird dependencies on corner cases of APIs, so it's best to
avoid cases where the behavior differs depending on which implementation of the
API is used.  So far it's been pretty straightforward to get all the crypto
implementations consistent, so IMO we should simply continue to do that.

What might make sense is moving more checks into the common code so that
implementations need to handle less, e.g. see how
https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10949189/ proposed to check the message
length alignment for skciphers (though that particular patch is broken as-is).
