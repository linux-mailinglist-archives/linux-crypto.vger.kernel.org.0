I'm not sure I understand why the 32x32 performance discussion is even
happening in the first place. The new 32x32 code most certainly
doesn't make anything worse. It most likely makes some things better
in some places -- 8% on that machine I fired up, maybe more and maybe
less other places. But who even cares? The principle advantage of this
patchset is the 64x64 code, and I think we gain something else,
immeasurable, by having parallel and comparable implementations.
Please, let's not turn this into another pointless debate.
