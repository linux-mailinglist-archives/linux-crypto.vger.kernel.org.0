Sure, but it makes little sense to use different random implementations
unless there are specific issues in terms of performance. It is also
not always easy to establish if a certain use of random numbers is
actually security relevant, may be context dependent, so it is
generally safer to just use the certified implementation for everything
if possible.

Well, given I am interested primarily in FIPS certifications I was
referring specifically to SP800-90A/B/C:
https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-90a/rev-1/final
https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-90b/final
https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-90c/draft

Stephan posted you the link a few days ago for one of the examples.
If you look at the last year you also will see that multiple patches
have gone in w/o the maintainer interacting, which is fine for obvious
stuff, but does not work for stuff that requires more feedback.

This is a Catch-22, the maintainer is mum in what would be acceptable,
and whenever there are patches sent, there is no feedback on whether
they are acceptable or not. It's not like I like blaming anyone, but it
would be nice to have at least one word that gives a direction to
follow that the maintainer is willing to then engage with and review or
at least accept with proper third party review.

Seem like a lot more are desired too :-)

Simo.
