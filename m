This is actually from commit b8aa7dc5c753 ("crypto: drivers - set the flag
CRYPTO_ALG_ALLOCATES_MEMORY"), which set CRYPTO_ALG_ALLOCATES_MEMORY in
marvell-cesa.  7bcb2c99f8ed is just one of the prerequisite commits.

I understand that the dm-crypt developers did this as an intentional bug fix in
order to prevent dm-crypt from using crypto drivers that are known to cause
deadlocks due to allocating memory during requests.

If you are interested in still being able to use marvell-cesa with dm-crypt, I
believe it would need to be fixed to meet the requirements for not needing
CRYPTO_ALG_ALLOCATES_MEMORY.  I've Cc'ed the maintainers of that driver.

#regzbot introduced: b8aa7dc5c753
