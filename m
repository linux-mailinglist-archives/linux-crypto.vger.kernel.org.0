You can use __cacheline_aligned as a modifier on struct members that
are accessed by the device. However, this is a typical value, not a
worst case value, and since this is taken into account at compile
time, you really need a worst case value.

On arm64, the maximum CWG (Cache Writeback Granule) value is 2k, which
is a bit excessive, so it might help to do this at runtime. One thing
you might do is increase the reqsize at TFM init time (in which case
you could also check whether the device is cache coherent for DMA),
and have a helper that gives you the address of the sub-struct inside
the request struct based on the current cache alignment.
