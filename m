Yes, of course. I understand the purpose all of this serves.

Asking the user to provide the flag is throwing the problem at the user -
so indeed, not a good idea. But that still doesn't mean we need to have
"rea->src =3D=3D req->dst" in every driver. We can have the API framework
do this.

Yes, if it is indeed a scatterlist and length. In fact it isn't - it's
a scatterlist
and four different lengths: plaintext, associated data, IV and auth tag.
Some of them are used in various scenarios and some aren't.
Which is exactly my point.

Yes, that's not a good option - but neither is having a comment that
can be read to imply
that the API requires it if it doesn't :-)

Thinking about it, I'm wondering if having something like this will
save boilerplate code in many drivers:

static inline bool crypto_aead_inplace(struct aead_request req)
{
        return (req->src =3D=3D req->dst);
}

unsigned int crypto_aead_sg_len(struct aead_request req, bool enc, bool src=
,
                                 int authsize, bool need_iv)
{
        struct crypto_aead *tfm =3D crypto_aead_reqtfm(req);
        unsigned int len =3D req->assoclen + req->cryptlen;

        if (need_iv)
                len +=3D crypto_aead_ivsize(tfm);

        if (src && !enc) || (!src && enc) || crypto_aead_inplace(req))
                len +=3D authsize;

        return len;
}

It would be better even if we can put the authsize and need_iv into the tfv
at registration time and not have to pass them as parameters at all.

Anyways, thanks for entertaining my ramblings... :-)

Thanks,
