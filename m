Yeah, and that, to
Forgot to mention it.

Also note that I've already folded the nvme-cli patches into the git
repository to ease testing; I gather that the interface won't change
that much anymore, so I felt justified in doing so.
And I got tired of explaining to interested parties how to build a
non-standard nvme-cli :-)
But that's why I didn't post separate patches for nvme-cli.

Cheers,

Hannes
