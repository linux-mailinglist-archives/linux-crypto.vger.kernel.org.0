In this case, just use (__force __Xe32*) to cast it to the correct
type. This annotates the cast as being intentionally endian-unclean,
and shuts up Sparse.

crypto_aes_ctx uses CPU endianness for the round keys.

In general, though, there is no such thing as endianness for a key
that is declared as u8[], it is simply a sequence of bytes. If the
hardware chooses to reorder those bytes for some reason, it is the
responsibility of the driver to take care of that from the CPU side.

You can boot big endian kernels on MacchiatoBin, in case that helps
(using u-boot, not EFI)
