Ok, will do.

I think, I showed this. The only real occurrences remaining for the
arch_get_random_seed_long() call is within softirq context when the
network layer tries to allocate some skb buffers. My personal feeling
about this is that it does not hurt - but I asked our network guys
and their feedback is clear: no way - every delay there may cause
high bandwidth traffic to stumble and this is to be absolutely avoided.
However, they can't give me any measurements.

So yes, the intention is now with checking for in_task() to prevent
the trng call in hard and soft interrupt context. But still I'd like
to meet your condition to provide good random at kernel startup.
