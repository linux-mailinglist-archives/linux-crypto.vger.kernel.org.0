Maybe I followed the Linux principle a bit to much here? Release early,=20
release often.

But with the v35, all goals I tried to achieve are now in (namely the last =
was=20
to get rid of any non-cryptographic conditioning functions) and to have a v=
ery=20
clean data processing / entropy analysis. I do not expect big changes any=20

Is this really so bad considering the security implications on this topic? =
We=20
also have multiple file systems, multiple memory allocators, etc...

Correct, but when assessing this function as part of [1], I found hardly an=
y=20
entropy being provided with this component.

Totally agreed, this is a bad design.

The core issue may very well be the SHA-1: using SHA-1 and folding its outp=

in half may be an artificial limit of the upper bound of entropy.

The hard limit is 2^48 generate operation with up to 2^16 bytes each. This =
is=20
a very large amount of data. If we start triggering reseeds early enough, a=

hard blocking may not be needed.

This is not required.
