Another way to handle this part is to calculate the hash in userspace
and handle the kernel just the hashes. This would allow you to remove
MD4 from the kernel. I guess it would break putting a password on the
kernel command line, but is that really a thing to do? Kernels do not
boot from cifs shares so you can always use userspace tools (or pass
hexed hashes directly on the command line in a pinch).

MD5 is still used for a ton of stuff, however it may make sense to
consider moving it in /lib and our of /lib/crypto as it is not usable
in cryptographic settings anymore anyway.
