Thanks!
I see that you have found an other spot to save 1 cycle.

Last results: poly1305: 4096 bytes,     188.671 MB/sec,     9066 cycles

I also wonder if we can also replace the "li $x, -4" and "and $x" with  
"sll $x"
combination on other places like [0], also on line 1169?

Replace this on line 1169, works on my device.

-       li      $in0,-4
         srl     $ctx,$tmp4,2
-       and     $in0,$in0,$tmp4
         andi    $tmp4,$tmp4,3
+       sll     $in0, $ctx, 2
         addu    $ctx,$ctx,$in0

Thanks for this information.
I wonder how many devices do exist with the "poor man" version.

Greats,

René
