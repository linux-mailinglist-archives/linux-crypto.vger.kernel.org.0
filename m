What exactly are you suggesting, then?  It seems that you want multibuffer
hashing to be supported by the existing ahash API.  However, that only works if
it's made asynchronous, given how the messages would have to be queued up on a
global queue.  That has a huge number of issues which I've already explained.
(And it was even tried before, and it failed.)

It's the other way around.  The shash version is much simpler.  Just look at the
diff of commit 8fcd94add6c5 that changed from ahash to shash:

    4 files changed, 71 insertions(+), 200 deletions(-)

fsverity and dm-verity will have to be updated to use multibuffer hashing
anyway, given that transparently supporting it in the existing API is not
viable.  If your concern is that in my current patchset fsverity and dm-verity
have separate code paths for multibuffer vs. single-buffer, as I mentioned I can
address that by restructuring them to operate on arrays (similar to what I
already did with the crypto API part).

XFS is working on adding support for fsverity, and XFS was planning to provide
their Merkle tree blocks in vmalloced buffers.  Their plans have shifted several
times, and I think their latest plan no longer uses vmalloced buffers.  But in
any case it's still very convenient and much simpler to be able to just use
virtual addresses without having to worry about what type of memory it is.
