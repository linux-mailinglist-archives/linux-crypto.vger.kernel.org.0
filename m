As far as I know the problem still exists.

We want to upgrade libkcapi on our target, but still facing the issue 
with libkcapi newer than 1.1.3 : When a file is bigger than 32 Kb, 
hashing operation (md5 or sha256) fails and the kernel prints the 
following message:

[ 2369.772999] talitos b0030000.crypto: length exceeds h/w max limit

Is there a way to tell crypto kernel core that a given driver has a 
fixed limit and that data shall be sent in chunks ? Or is it the 
responsibility of the driver to cut off the data in acceptable chunks ? 
I guess the Talitos driver is not the only driver with such a limit, so 
something centralised must exist to handle it ?

Thanks
Christophe
