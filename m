Thanks, appreciated.  This way of handling it spares me from having
to resubmit the patch without assume().  (The patch is prep work
for upcoming PCI device authentication.)

I've been in touch with Julia (+cc) to silence this coccinelle
false-positive.  But now that the assume() is gone, the coccinelle
warning won't appear anyway:

Curiously, this particular 0-day report is for gcc 13.2.0 though,
not clang.

The assume() macro had no effect with clang when I tested it.
So the unnecessary IS_ERR() check persisted despite the macro when
compiling with clang.  Only gcc honors it.  Probably another reason
why you would hate the macro. :)

clang supports __builtin_assume().  In theory that should have the
same effect as __builtin_unreachable() on gcc (albeit with inverse
boolean semantics).  In practice it had no effect.  (Tested with
clang 15.0.6.)

https://clang.llvm.org/docs/LanguageExtensions.html#builtin-assume

So with clang there doesn't seem to be a working way to tell the
compiler about assumptions it can make.  And with gcc it's apparently
"hit and miss" depending on the exact gcc version and code. :(

Yes.

I guess this effort was over the top, so apologies for the noise!

Thanks,

Lukas
