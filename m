There is already check in kernel for XTS "weak" keys (tweak and encryption keys must not be the same).
  https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/include/crypto/xts.h#n27

For now it applies only in FIPS mode... (and if I see correctly it is duplicated in all drivers).
