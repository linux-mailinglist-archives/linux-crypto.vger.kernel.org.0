Well, that's quite long ago :)

Yes, separating flows is for performance reasons. In networking, the packet
order inside a flow is very important. If network packets get reordered,
performance will drop down. So packets of the same flow should always
stay on the same cpu, otherwise you can't ensure the packet order. But to
process the network packets as parallel as possible, you can move different
flows to different cpus by choosing a callback cpu for each flow.

That's great, go ahead!
