Yes, I have verified this code and it is correct. The reason is that if pP is used here,
the inactive elements of zB will be ignored in zX, which will cause data loss.(I think it is
because the zB data is covered by the multiplication and addition results of zX, zA, and zV
using movprfx and mad. Have I got that right?) :)

On the other hand zX uses the prediction register pP/z when loading data, the value of the
inactive element is 0, the inactive element in zX will not affect the final result, the inactive
element in zB will be directly assigned to the inactive element of zX element.

Then in the next instruction, it will be added to zB along with zX.

Yes I deleted it.

X10 and X11 are part A and part B of the initial value of adler32 passed in by the caller.

If a 64-bit wide vector register is used, for most scenes where the amount of data is not particularly large,
is it wasted more vector resources?

Maybe we can also try to use 16-bit wide vector registers to load data and calculations,
and accumulate them into the scalar register xn before overflow, just like my original patch,
but I can try to use ascending order to change the processing of the last loop Be more elegant.

I don't quite understand what it means here. Does it mean that the input bytes are read into the vector in
blocks for calculation (this is how it is done now) or the intermediate results are stored in different elements
of the vector in blocks during the calculation process? :-)
