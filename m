It's not a coprocessor, it's a way you talk to coprocessors.

But you're right it's not part of the ISA.

The problem with that is it's shared between two existing platforms, ie.
powernv and pseries. We don't want to put it in one or the other.

In the past we have put code like that in arch/powerpc/sysdev, but I am
not a big fan of it, because it's just a bit of a dumping ground.

A while back I created arch/powerpc/platforms/4xx for 40x and 44x
related things, even though there's no actual 4xx platform. I don't
think that's caused any problems.

So I'm inclined to say we should make a arch/powerpc/platforms/book3s
and put VAS in there.

The naming is a bit fishy, because not all book3s CPUs do or will have
VAS. But we would expect any future CPU with VAS to be book3s.

In contrast if we named it platforms/ibm, we could potentially have a
future non-IBM CPU that contains VAS, which would then make the ibm name
confusing.

cheers
