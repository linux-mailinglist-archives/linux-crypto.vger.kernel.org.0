That was *exactly* my first question too.

FWIW I'd rather have a few kB of shareable entropy-expansion .text in
userspace than a few kB per process (or even per thread? >_<) of
nonshareable data any day.

Exactly.

FWIW I've been kinda waiting to see what glibc would do on this after
the posix_random proposal failed, before considering much what we
should do in musl, but the value I see in either is not as an
optimization but as honoring a well-known interface so we have fewer
applications doing their own stupid YOLO stuff trying to get secure
entropy and botching it. So far the best we have is getentropy but it
fails on old kernels. At some point musl will probably implement both
arc4random and getentropy with secure fallback process for old
kernels -- certainly the fallback is needed for meeting the arc4random
contract and I'd like it on both places.
