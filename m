OK, consider me persuaded. We are already exposing xts(...) to
userland, and since we already implement a proper subset of true XTS,
it will be simply a matter of making sure that the existing XTS
implementations don't regress in performance on the non-CTS code
paths.

It would be useful, though, to have some generic helper functions,
e.g., like the one we have for CBC, or the one I recently proposed for
CTS, so that existing implementations (such as the bit sliced AES) can
easily be augmented with a CTS code path (but performance may not be
optimal in those cases). For the ARM implementations based on AES
instructions, it should be reasonably straight forward to implement it
close to optimally by reusing some of the code I added for CBC-CTS
(but I won't get around to doing that for a while). If there are any
volunteers for looking into the generic or x86/AES-NI implementations,
please come forward :-) Also, if any of the publications that were
quoted in this thread have suitable test vectors, that would be good
to know.
