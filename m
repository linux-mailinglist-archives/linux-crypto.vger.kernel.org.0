If I'm understanding you correctly, you're saying that we will never
get into the host's page fault handler due to an RMP violation if we
implement the unmapping guest private memory proposal (without bugs).

However, bugs do happen. And the host-side page fault handler will
have code to react to an RMP violation (even if it's supposedly
impossible to hit). I'm saying that the host-side page fault handler
should NOT handle an RMP violation by killing host-side processes or
the kernel itself. This is detrimental to host reliability.

There are two ways to handle this. (1) Convert the private page
causing the RMP violation to shared, (2) Kill the guest.

Converting the private page to shared is a good solution in SNP's
threat model. And overall, it's better for debuggability than
immediately terminating the guest.

We should handle RMP violations as best possible from within the
host-side page fault handler, independent of the proposal to unmap
private guest memory for all CVM architectures. Otherwise, if someone
figures out how to trigger an RMP violation by writing guest private
memory (despite unmapping guest private memory's goal to make this
impossible), the attack surface has now increased. Because now we're
either killing host processes or the kernel. Which is worse than
killing the single guest.

Second, I don't think it's correct to say that the host-side
implementation changes the attack surface. The guest must already be
hardened against host-side bugs and attacks. From the guest's
perspective, the attack surface is the same. Also, unmapping private
guest memory is going to require coordination across host userspace,
host kernel, and guest. That's a lot of code. And typically more code
means more attack surface. That being said, if all that code is
implemented perfectly, you might be right, that unmapping guest
private memory makes it harder for the host to attack the guest. But I
think it's a moot point. Because in the end, converting the page from
private to shared is entirely reasonable to solve this problem for
SNP, and we should be doing it irregardless, even if we do get
unmapping private memory working on SNP.
