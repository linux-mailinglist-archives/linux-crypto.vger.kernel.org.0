That's not surprising. But also, does it matter? That script has
*always* been wrong. Writing to /dev/urandom like that has *never*
ensured that those bytes are taken into account immediately after. It's
just not how that interface works. So any assumptions based on that are
bogus, and that line effectively does nothing.

Fortunately, however, the kernel itself incorporates hwrng output into
the rng pool, so you don't need to think about doing it yourself.

So go ahead and remove that line from your script.

Now as far as the "regression" goes, we've made an already broken
userspace script take 3 minutes longer than usual, but it still does
eventually complete, so it's not making boot impossible or something.
How this relates to the "don't break userspace" rule might be a matter
of opinion. If you think it does, maybe send a patch to Herbert reducing
that sleep from 1000 to 100 and stating why with my background above,
and see if he agrees it's worth fixing. Or, if removing that line from
your scripts is good enough for you, that's also fine by me.

Jason
