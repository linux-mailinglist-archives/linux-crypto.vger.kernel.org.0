Thanks for reviewing this patch. I understand your concern about the erroneous
use of the entropy input by non-testing applications. This was an approach that
I had discussed with Ard. I should have included you, my apologies. I'll  post
v2 with the CAVS testing stuff hidden under CONFIG_ option with appropriate help
text.

With regards to the usefulness, let me elaborate. This effort of extending the
drbg interface is driven by Android needs for having the kernel crypto
certified. I started from having an out-of-tree chrdev driver for Google Pixel
kernels that was exposing the required crypto functionality, and it wasn't ideal
in the following ways:
 * it primarily consisted of copypasted code from testmgr.c
 * it was hard for me to keep the code up to date because I'm not aware of
   ongoing changes to crypto
 * it is hard for other people and/or organisations to re-use it, hense a lot of
   duplicated effort is going into CAVS: you have a private driver, I have mine,
   Jaya from HP <jayalakshmi.bhat@hp.com>, who's been asking linux-crypto a few
   CAVS questions, has to develop theirs...

In general Android is trying to eliminate out-of-tree code. CAVS testing
functionality in particular needs to be upstream because we are switching all
Android devices to using a Generic Kernel Image (GKI)
[https://lwn.net/Articles/771974/] based on the upstream kernel.

For Android certification purposes, we only need to test the modules which are
actually being used. In our case it's what af_alg already exposes plus DRBG.
If, say, HP would need RSA, they could submit their own patch.

As for exposing bits of the internal state for some algorithms, I hope guarding
the testing functionality with a CONFIG_ option would solve the security part of
the problem.

I considered publishing my kernel driver on GitHub, but there appears to be a
sufficiently large number of users to justify having this functionality
upstream.

Hope that addresses your concerns.
