Consider the flow for a non-coherent DMA_FROM_DEVICE transfer:

1: dma_map_page() - cleans and invalidates caches to prevent any dirty 
lines being written back during the transfer
2: CPU cache may prefetch the buffer back in at any time from now on 
(e.g. if other threads access nearby memory), but that's OK since the 
CPU must not actually access it until after step 4, and clean lines 
don't get written back
3: device writes to buffer - non-coherent so goes straight to DRAM
4: dma_unmap_page() - invalidates caches to discard any clean lines 
speculatively fetched since step 1
5: CPU reads from buffer - fetches new data into cache, all is well

Now consider what can happen if the device is secretly coherent, but the 
DMA API still uses the same non-coherent flow:

1: dma_map_page() - cleans and invalidates caches to prevent any dirty 
lines being written back during the transfer
2: CPU cache *does* happen to prefetch the buffer back in
3: device writes to buffer - write snoop hits in cache so data goes 
there instead of DRAM
4: dma_unmap_page() - invalidates caches, unknowingly destroying new data
5: CPU reads from page - fetches whatever old data was cleaned to DRAM 
in step 1, hilarity ensues.

Note that it still *can* work out OK in the (likely) case that the 
prefetch at step 2 doesn't happen, so in step 3 the snoop doesn't hit 
and the data does end up going to DRAM, or (less likely) the updated 
dirty lines are naturally evicted and written back between steps 3 and 4.

Similarly, if a buffer is mmap'ed to userspace (or remapped for coherent 
DMA) with non-cacheable attributes on the assumption that the device is 
non-coherent - the cacheable alias from the kernel linear map can still 
be present in caches, so coherent device accesses can unexpectedly hit 
that and fail to observe CPU reads and writes going straight to/from 
DRAM via the non-cacheable alias. We hit this case with Panfrost on some 
Amlogic platforms not too long ago.

Hope that helps clarify things.

Robin.
