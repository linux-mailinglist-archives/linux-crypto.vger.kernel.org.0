So after completely changing several times your proposal is getting a bit closer
to mine, but it still uses a very clumsy API based around ahash that would be
much harder to use and implement correctly.  It also says nothing about what the
API would look like on the shash side, which would be needed anyway because
ahash is almost always just a pointless wrapper for shash.  Is there a different
API that you are asking for on the shash side?  If so, what?

To reiterate, with my proposal there is only one state in memory.  It's a simple
API that can't be misused by providing inconsistent properties in the requests.
Yes, separate states would be needed if we were to support arbitrary updates,
but why add all that complexity before it's actually needed?

Also, "16 and beyond" is highly unlikely to be useful for kernel use cases.

... which would make it useless for most dm-verity users, as dm-verity uses a
32-byte salt with SHA-256 (which has a 64-byte block size) by default.

The diff from switching fsverity from ahash to shash clearly demonstrates
otherwise.  Yes, fsverity has to map the pages to pass into shash, but that's a
very minor thing compared to all the complexity of ahash that was saved.  And
fsverity already had to map most of the pages anyway to access them.
