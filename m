That's kind of expected, but Marijn's defconfig is fine. I just like
baking my firmware into the kernel for faster boot times.

These instructions are meant for use with Sony Open Devices trees
available at github.com/sonyxperiadev, currently with CAF-based kernel
4.14.

This one is for use with stock-based (BSP 4.4 kernel) trees.

First of all, you're going to need to retrieve gpu firmware (530
pfp/pm4 and 508 ZAP) like I do here (please flash the latest ODM image
from here to the oem partition [1] with fastboot) [2].

We are successfully booting Android but need multiple patches around,
in particular to enable A508 in Mesa (basically find "case 510:" and
add "case 508:" above it, like here [3]. For basic functionality,
we're working on proper 508/509/512 support) and the android device
trees aren't in the best state.. We're going to focus on these when
other components are ready.
