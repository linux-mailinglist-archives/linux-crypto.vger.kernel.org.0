Sure. When you look at this it's just weird to have a specific firmware
tied to an 'else' without having a check for a given version. Having the
"no firmware" option as the default option or not does not change
anything at runtime in practice here. If you prefer throwing an error if
the version isn't supported, I'm OK with it as well.

Yes, I mean my point is that you can't know the future for sure, but I
agree you'll surely end up with a better solution :)

Hehe :) I think this is more a coding style non-written requirement than
something backed up with a technical reason, or it's possible I'm not
aware of the reason. Anyway, this is often asked in reviews, and you
won't find many examples of this in existing code.

I could say the same (I do think it's good that you want to know the
reason behind requirements and comments). I didn't comment specifically
on the lengthy explanations you gave, but it helped me to understand
your point, how the h/w engines we'll support are designed and
integrated and the reason behind lots of your choices. I know we spent
a lot of time discussing various points and I'm pretty sure this is
because we need to both ramp up (on the diversity of engines and on
the upstream process) but I'm sure this is only temporary.

One of the examples where those discussions will be useful is if/when
we'll have more of compatibles to support in the driver, as those cannot
be removed once merged.

I could continue arguing on the 'version', but let's say we're on the
same page for now and if ever I see a reason to factorize some code
regarding this we can always discuss it later, as this it's internal to
the driver.

Thanks for taking the time :)
