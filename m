This looks good to me.

There are still a few bits that need to be removed/updated.  With a quick grep,
I found:

sysdeps/generic/tls-internal-struct.h:  struct arc4random_state_t *rand_state;

sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/tls-internal.h:/* Reset the arc4random TCB state on fork.  *

NEWS: ... The functions use a pseudo-random number generator along with
NEWS: entropy from the kernel.


Also, the documentation in manual/math.texi should say that the randomness is
cryptographically secure.
