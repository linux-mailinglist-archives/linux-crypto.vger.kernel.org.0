This is overly restrictive, and not in line with reality. The whole
networking stack operates on buffers shifted by 2 bytes if
NET_IP_ALIGN is left at its default value of 2. There are numerous
examples in other places as well.

Given that kmalloc() will take the cacheline granularity into account
if necessary, the only way this issue can hit is when a single kmalloc
buffer is written to by two different masters.

I remember that. But in the discussion that followed, I did ask about
accessing the memory while the buffer is mapped for DMA, and I
misunderstood the response. The scatterwalk_map_and_copy writes to the
request while it is mapped for DMA.

I'm on the fence here. On the one hand, it is slightly dodgy for the
GCM driver to pass a scatterlist referencing a buffer that shares a
cacheline with another buffer passed by an ordinary pointer, and for
which an explicit requirement exists that the callee should update it
before returning.

On the other hand, I think it is reasonable to require drivers not to
perform such updates while the scatterlist is mapped for DMA, since
fixing it in the callers puts a disproportionate burden on them, given
that non-coherent DMA only represents a small minority of use cases.
