That's what I had in mind with "hctr2(xctr_name, polyval_name)".

Well, the single block cipher isn't used just in ->setkey(), but also in
->encrypt() and ->decrypt() (not for the bulk of the data, but for 1 block).
So allowing its implementation to be specified might make sense.

Alternatively the single block cipher could be emulated with xctr which the
template already has, similar to how the cts template only uses cbc, but I think
that would be pretty messy here.
