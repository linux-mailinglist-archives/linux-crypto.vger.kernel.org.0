Okay, so I read Ross's earlier email rather differently:

I assumed that "deliberately cap" meant that there was an actual
feature where you write something to the event log (if applicable) and
extend the PCR in a special way that *turns that PCR off*.  That is,
it does something such that later-loaded software *can't* use that PCR
to attest or unseal anything, etc.

But it sounds like you're saying that no such feature exists.  And a
quick skim of the specs doesn't come up with anything.  And the SHA1
banks may well be susceptible to a collision attack.

So what are the kernel's choices wrt the SHA-1 PCRs?  It can:

a) Perform business as usual: extend them consistently with the
SHA-256 PCRs.  This is sort of *fine*: the kernel code in question is
not relying on the security of SHA-1, but it is making it possible for
future code to (unwisely) rely on them.  (Although, if the kernel is
loading a trustworthy initramfs, then there won't be a collision, and
there is no known second-preimage attack against SHA-1.)

b) Same as (a), but with countermeasures: do something to the effect
of *detecting* the attack a la SHA1-DC and panic if an attack is
detected.  Maybe this is wise; maybe it's not.

c) Do not extend the SHA-1 PCRs and pretend they don't exist.  This
seems likely to cause massive security problems, and having the kernel
try to defend its behavior by saying "we don't support SHA-1 -- this
is a problem downstream" seems unwise to me.

d) Extend them but in an unconventional way that makes using them
extra secure.  For example, calculate SHA-256(next stage), then extend
with (next stage || "Linux thinks this is better" || SHA-256(next
stage).  This makes the SHA-1 banks usable, and it seems like it will
probably defeat anything resembling a current attack.  But maybe this
is silly.  It would probably require doing the same thing to the
SHA-256 banks for the benefit of any software that checks whether the
SHA-1 and SHA-256 banks are consistent with each other.

e) Actually try to make the SHA-1 PCRs unusable.  For example, extend
them with random numbers.

My inclination is that having some kind of Linux "policy" that SHA-1
is forbidden adds no actual security value.  Option (a) honestly seems
fine.  Nothing in the kernel *relies* on the SHA-1 hash being secure.
But option (b) also seems okay if someone is willing to put the effort
into implementing it and creating a proper test case.

But the description of all this could certainly do a better job of
explaining what's going on.

Wow.  I skimmed this paper.  What an overcomplicated solution to a
problem that doesn't deserve to exist in the first place.
