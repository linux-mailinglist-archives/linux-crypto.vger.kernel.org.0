True. But the fallback only gets executed if the scheduler is stupid
enough to schedule the TX task onto the core that is overloaded doing
RX softirqs. So in the general case, both TX and RX will be using
AES-NI instructions (unless the CCMP is done in hardware which is the
most common case by far)

Wireless is very different. Wifi uses a medium that is fundamentally
shared, and so the load it can induce is bounded. There is no way a
wifi interface is going to saturate a 64-bit AES-NI core doing CCMP in
software.

Given the above, can't we be pragmatic here? This code addresses a
niche use case, which is not affected by the general concerns
regarding async crypto.
