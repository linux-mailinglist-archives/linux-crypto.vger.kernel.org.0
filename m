What do you mean by just one direction? Ben just confirmed a
substantial speedup for his use case, which requires the use of
software encryption even on hardware that could support doing it in
hardware, and that software encryption currently only supports the
synchronous interface.

Even if it is nicer in theory, I don't see the point of implementing
support for the asynchronous interface, given that nobody is going to
wire up a AES accelerator to a wifi controller.

Why? The processing occurs in *exactly* the same way, given that the
wifi stack never calls into the AEAD from a context where the FPU is
unavailable. So we basically have to choose between a non-SIMD
fallback path that never gets exercised, or a SIMD async helper that
always relays the request directly, and never queues it for
asynchronous completion.

IOW, we are arguing a theoretical difference here, and the code paths
that actually get exercised are 100% the same.
