Yes, but the larger we make this number, the more time the test will
take on such slow machines. Doing 1000 iterations of 4k on a low-end
machine that only manages 500 MB/s (?) takes a couple of milliseconds,
which is more than it does today when HZ=1000 I think.

Not that 800 vs 1000 makes a great deal of difference in that regard,
just illustrating that there is an upper bound as well.
