No; I meant that the test could use lm_alias() on the test vectors
before passing those to sg_set_buf(), when the test code knows by
construction that those vectors happen to be part of the kernel image.
That'll work on all architectures.

That said, looking at the code it appears that testmgr.c can be built as
a module, so the test vectors could be module/vmalloc addresses rather
than virt/linear or image addresses. Given that, I don't think the
changes suggested here are sufficient, as module addresses should still
be rejected.

Can we kmemdup() the test vector data first? That'd give us a legitimate
virt/linear address that we can use.

I don't think arm64 is doing anything wrong here; an image address is
*not* a virt/linear address, and we only fix that up in virt_to_*() as a
best-effort thing. I think other architectures which accept that are
signing themselves up for subtle bugs that we're trying to prevent
early.

Mark.
