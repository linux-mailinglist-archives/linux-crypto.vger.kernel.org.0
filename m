Not necessarily.  It'll only allocate the page if the request size
exceeds the buffer we already have in the request context.  The
request context size is dependent on the request context size of
the underlying CBC, but it should be at least 512 bytes long.

I should probably test always using the 512-byte buffer and perhaps
it might be good enough.

Note that the numbers I'm getting with aesni is already very close
to the numbers of the underly cbc-aesni encryption so there is not
much room for improvement.

We could make the request context size be at least 2048 bytes long
and that would obviate the need to allocate the page buffer.

In any case, the cost of the page allocation is going to be drowned
out by the crypto since this would only happen for large requests.

Perhaps, but would this be significant compared to the crypto cost?
Only numbers can tell.

As I said before, I'm totally fine with a native aesni implementation
for ccm/cbcmac as long as it's fully async like everything else.  But
a ccm/cbcmac based on cbc still makes sense since we're not going to
reimplement the same thing in every crypto driver out there.
