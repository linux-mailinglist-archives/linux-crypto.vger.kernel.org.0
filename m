We do not enforce kernels version anymore, although we still support the
--enable-kernel=x.y that changes on how glibc internally assume some syscall
(so there is no need to fallback if it were the case).

So the question is where we need the fallback code for --enable-kernel=3.17.
If kernel is returning ENOSYS in this case (and assuming you are running on
kernel newer than 3.17) it means some syscall filtering, and I am not sure
we should need to actually handle it.  The main idea of adding this minor
optimization is to once we increase the minimum supported kernel we can
clean this code up.

I think the fallback code make sense since the minimum supported kernel we
still support is 3.2, although I am not sure how getrandom and/or /dev/urandom
will play in such older kernels.

I think so, although he __LINUX_KERNEL_VERSION is Linux-only that should 
be moved to sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux.

Usually we do as a wrapper (static inline or hidden symbol), with the generic
implementation on sysdep/generic or include with Linux redefining on its own
folder.

We also a use __ASSUME macros (check sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/kernel-features.h),
it should be something like __ASSUME_GETRANDOM (we did not have a use for it 
because we do not want a fallback for getrandom implementation).

So I would add something like:

sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/arc4random_impl.h


  static inline int getentropy_arch (void *p, size_t n)
  {
    for (;;)
      {
        ssize_t l = __getrandom_nocancel (p, n, 0);
        if (l > 0)
          {
            if (l == n)
             return true;
          }
        else if (l == 0)
          return -1;
        else if (l == -EINTR)
         continue;

  #if !__ASSUME_GETRANDOM
        if (l == -ENOSYS)
          return 0;
  #endif
        return -1;
      }
    return 1;
  }

And on stdlib/arc4random.c:

  void
  __arc4random_buf (void *p, size_t n)
  {
    if (n == 0)
      return;

    int s = getentropy_arch (p, n);
    if (s > 0)
      return;
    if (s < 0)
      arc4random_getrandom_failure ()

    /* Fallback.  */
  }

Maybe add a comment stating it.

Good question, I don't think we enforce it in fact.

Yeah, I meant after indeed.
