See page 6 of "Comments on XTS":

	Note that j = 0 must be excluded, as f(0, v) = v for any v, which
	implies ρ = 1. Moreover, if j = 0 was allowed, a simple attack based on
	this fact existed, as pointed out by [6] and [3]. Hence if XEX is used,
	one must be careful to avoid j being 0.

The part you quoted is only talking about XTS *as specified*, i.e. with 2 keys.

It's broken, so it's broken.  Doesn't matter who is using it.

As I said, the attack is explained in the original XEX paper.  Basically the
adversary can submit a chosen ciphertext query for the first block of sector 0
to leak the first "mask" of that sector, then submit a chosen plaintext or
ciphertext query for the reminder of the sector such that they can predict the
output with 100% certainty.  (The standard security model for tweakable block
ciphers says the output must appear random.)
