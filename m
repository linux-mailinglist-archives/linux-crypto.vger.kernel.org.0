Apologies, I did not mean to imply that you don't understand your own hardware.

Those are usually the consequences of a HW guy deciding to punt
something to software. The software never looks better for it :-)

Yuck indeed. Sacrificing correctness for reduced silicon area comes with a cost.

This is intractible. Software already exists that does not treat the
zero length vector as a special case. Such software may be plumbed
into the kernel crypto API via its AF_ALG interface. So the only
wiggling room we have is in the kernel driver.

As others have pointed out as well, h/w accelerated crypto is exposed
to userland, so nobody knows how exactly it is being used in the
field.
