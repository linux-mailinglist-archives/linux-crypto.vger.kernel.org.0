The pkey is in fact a encrypted key + a verification pattern for the
encrypted key used. It gets invalid when this encryption key changes.
The encryption key changes when the LPAR is re-activated so for
example on suspend/resume or an Linux running as kvm guest
gets relocated. So this happens very rarely.
