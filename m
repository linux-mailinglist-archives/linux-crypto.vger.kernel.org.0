I can generate some very complicated traffic to test this, including bi-directional
traffic, mix of tcp/udp/https, etc.  If numbers will sway your opinion, let me know what
traffic tests will make you happy and I'll do the testing.

I know for sure that in download traffic (which is normal dominant direction for wifi stations),
Ard's patch gives me about 3x increase of throughput.  Without the patch, softirqd is pegged
100% futzing around with enabling and disabling the fpu.

The wifi stack people do not want any extra complexity in their code,
and async processing of this would be a lot of complexity.  So, even if I wanted
to implement it, likely it would never make it upstream anyway.

I also suspect that general users may benefit from this aesni patch since
many older wifi chipsets don't support wpa3 in hardware and wpa3 is the new
hotness in wifi.

Thanks,
Ben
