Subject: [RFC PATCH 36/41] random: optimize the APT's presearch

The Adaptive Proportion Test's presearch phase is supposed to determine the
sample value occurring more than half of the times among the first n1=7
events in a sequence, if there is any such one.

To this end, it maintains eight counters at struct health_test for counting
the numbers of ones observed at each of the eight resp. bit positions
within the sample values' octets. The idea is that if any sample value had
been encountered more than half of the time, it would dominate all these
counters and its value could be restored unambiguously from them.

For better reviewability, this had been implemented in the most
straightforward way:
- the counters had been represented as an array of eight u8s at struct
  health_test and
- both, the counter updating as well as the candidate extracion code had
  been implemented by means of a loop over the eight bit positions.

As this is all accessed from add_interrupt_randomness(), optimizations
won't harm. In particular, using a total of eight bytes for the bit
counters is wasteful and can be reduced to half of that, optimizing the
size of struct health_test, which in turn is stored as part of the per-CPU
struct fast_pool.

For counts up to n1=7, 3 bits would suffice. Rather than using an array of
eight u8s, store the bit counter within an u32's eight four-bit nibbles.

Even though it probably won't matter on average in practice, because the
APT presearch is run only for a small fraction of all IRQ events, reduce
the number of instructions issued from the bit counter maintenance and
candidate extraction code as well. If nothing else, this can potentially
reduce the maximum IRQ latency by a few cycles.

Namely, make the bit counter updating code in health_apt_presearch_update()
spread the eight bits from the input sample evenly across an u32. That is,
the bit at position i will end up at position 4*i. This can be achieved
within five binops and four shifts. This intermediate value can then get
subsequently added in a single operation to the "packed" bit counters kept
in struct health_test in order to conclude the operation.

As for the final candidate extraction in health_apt_presearch_finalize(),
remember that the i'th counter needs to get compared against
n1 / 2 = 7 / 2 in order to restore the i'th bit from the resulting
candidate value. The condition that one such bit counter is >= 4 is
equivalent to testing its bit at the 2nd position, counted from zero.
Thus, (->apt_presearch_bit_counters & 0x44444444) >> 2
will yield a value where the LSB from the i'th nibble, equals the i'th bit
from the result and everything else is unset. The final result can then be
obtained by "shrinking" this intermediate representation back into an u8.
In total, the candidate extraction can be achieved within a sequence of
seven binops and six shifts.
