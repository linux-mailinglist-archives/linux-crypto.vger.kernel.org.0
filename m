Could you resubmit this with first my original commit and then with your
changes on top? I'd like to see and be able to review exactly what's
changed. If I recall correctly, Ren√© and I were really starved for
registers and tried pretty hard to avoid spilling to the stack, so I'm
interested to learn how you crammed a bit more sauce in there.

I also wonder if maybe it'd be better to just leave this as is with 20
rounds, which it was previously optimized for, and just not do
accelerated Adiantum for MIPS. Android has long since given up on the
ISA entirely.
