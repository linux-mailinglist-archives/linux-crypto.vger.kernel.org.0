Hi, this is a bad interpretation from me.

I thought that S[1] would likely use an odd address and would trigger an 
unaligned access. But as we would read only 1 byte, this is not the case.

Looking at [1], we have : "At this point, it should be clear that 
accessing a single byte (u8 or char) will never cause an unaligned 
access, because all memory addresses are evenly divisible by one."


I wanted to avoid potential performance cost related to using char (i.e 
u8) instead of int (i.e. u32).
On some architecture this could require some shift or masking or 
whatever to "unpack" the values of S.
