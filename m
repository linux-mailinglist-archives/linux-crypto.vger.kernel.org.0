I assume your AndyP comment below didn't apply to this top item here.
This one should be fairly uncontroversial in your opinion, right?

Yea I share your concerns here. From preliminary results, I think the
Poly1305 code will be globally better, and I don't think we'll need an
abundance of discussion about it.

The ChaCha case is more interesting. I'll submit this with lots of
packet-sized microbenchmarks, as well as on-the-wire WireGuard
testing. Eric - I'm guessing you don't care too much about Adamantium
performance on x86 where people are probably better off with AES-XTS,
right? Are there other specific real world cases we care about? IPsec
is another one, but those concerns, packet-size wise, are more or less
the same as for WireGuard. But anyway, we can cross this bridge when
we come to it.

Haha, "last but not least" :)

Thanks, yea, that makes sense. Netdev also has its own merge window
schedule that I should aim to meet. I guess, based on this if I'm
understanding correctly, we're looking at WireGuard for 5.5?
