While I see your point, my intention is to avoid changes beyond
formatting and interface adjustments so the kernel code would not
diverge from the reference one. IMHO having this as a separate commit is
a good thing.

Further changes would need another round of review(s) and testing and
then it should be called 'based on reference code and heavily modified',
like the blake2s patch says.

The proposed patch looks good, though I'd rather address that
independently and perhaps also split it to individual changes so it's
clear how the code is transformed.
