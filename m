FYI: due to all the buggy hardware drivers and distros wanting to enable the
crypto self-tests in production, we did decide to restore the ability to run
only the "fast" crypto self-tests.  See:
https://lore.kernel.org/r/20250612174709.26990-1-ebiggers@kernel.org/

The full tests will once again not be enabled in any of the defconfigs.  You may
want to enable CRYPTO_SELFTESTS_FULL in arch/s390/configs/debug_defconfig.
