I'm not sure what you are alluding to here. I have always been very
clear about what I like about Zinc and what I don't like about Zinc.

I agree that it makes absolutely no sense for casual, in-kernel crypto
to jump through all the hoops that the crypto API requires. But for
operating on big chunks of data on the kernel heap, we have an
existing API that we should leverage if we can, and fix if we need to
so that all its users can benefit.

It doesn't have to be your way or my way. The whole point of being
part of this community is that we find solutions that work for
everyone, through discussion and iterative prototyping. Turning up out
of the blue with a 50,000 line patch set and a take-it-or-leave-it
attitude goes counter to that, and this is why we have made so little
progress over the past year.

But I am happy with your willingness to collaborate and find common
ground, which was also my motivation for spending a considerable
amount of time to prepare this patch set.

This is one of the issues in the 'fix it for everyone else as well'
category. If we can improve the crypto API to be less susceptible to
these issues (e.g., using static calls), everybody benefits. I'd be
happy to collaborate on that.

So are you saying that the handshake timing constraints in the
WireGuard protocol are so stringent that we can't run it securely on,
e.g., an ARM CPU that lacks a NEON unit? Or given that you are not
providing accelerated implementations of blake2s or Curve25519 for
arm64, we can't run it securely on arm64 at all?

Typically, I would prefer to only introduce different versions of the
same algorithm if there is a clear performance benefit for an actual
use case.

Framing this as a security issue rather than a performance issue is
slightly disingenuous, since people are less likely to challenge it.
But the security of any VPN protocol worth its salt should not hinge
on the performance delta between the reference C code and a version
that was optimized for a particular CPU.

Your implementation of RFC7539 truncates the nonce to 64-bits, while
RFC7539 defines a clear purpose for the bits you omit. Since the Zinc
library is intended to be standalone (and you are proposing its use in
other places, like big_keys.c), you might want to document your
justification for doing so in the general case, instead of ridiculing
the code I needed to write to work around this limitation.

Parsing the string and connecting the function pointers happens only
once, and only when the transform needs to be instantiated from its
constituent parts. Subsequent invocations will just grab the existing
object.

My preference would be to address this by permitting per-request keys
in the AEAD layer. That way, we can instantiate the transform only
once, and just invoke it with the appropriate key on the hot path (and
avoid any per-keypair allocations)

My changes actually move all the rfc7539() intermediate buffers to the
stack, so the only remaining allocation is the per-keypair one.

As I already pointed out, we have supported hardware already: CAAM is
in mainline, and Inside-Secure patches are on the list.

This is the reason I included your WG patch verbatim, to make it
easier to rebase to newer versions. In fact, I never intended or
expected anything but discussion from this submission, let alone
anyone actually merging it :-)

It uses the existing SIMD batching, and enhances it slightly for the
Poly1305/shash case.

We've already made improvements here for arm64 as well (and ARM
already used lazy restore). But I think it still makes sense to
amortize these calls over a reasonable chunk of data, i.e., a packet.

It all depends on whether we are interested in supporting async
accelerators or not, and it is clear what my position is on this
point.

I am not convinced that we need accelerated implementations of blake2s
and curve25519, but if we do, I'd like those to be implemented as
individual modules under arch/*/crypto, with some moduleloader fu for
weak symbols or static calls thrown in if we have to. Exposing them as
shashes seems unnecessary to me at this point.

My only objection to your simd get/put interface is that it uses a
typedef rather than a struct definition (although I also wonder how we
can avoid two instances living on the same call stack, unless we
forbid functions that take a struct simd* to call functions that don't
take one, but these are details we should be able to work out.)

What I *don't* want is to merge WireGuard with its own library based
crypto now, and extend that later for async accelerators once people
realize that we really do need that as well.
