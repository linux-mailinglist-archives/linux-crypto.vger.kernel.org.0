Subject: [RFC PATCH 32/41] random: introduce health test stub and wire it up

NIST SP800-90B requires certain statistical tests to be run continuously on
a noise source's output.

In preparation to implementing those, introduce an empty stub,
health_test_process() and wire it up to add_interrupt_randomness(). This
patch does not implement any actual testing functionality yet, it's mereley
meant to define the interactions between add_interrupt_randomness() and
the health tests.

health_test_process() is to be invoked on individual noise samples, i.e.
cycle counter values and returns, either of three possible status
codes indicating to the calling add_interrupt_randomness() that
- either some more samples are needed in order to complete the statistical
  tests,
- that the tests have finished with positive result on the latest run
  of noise samples or
- that the tests have failed.

Introduce an enum health_result defining constants corresponding to these
resp. cases: health_queue, health_dispatch and health_discard. Provide
another value, health_none, to indicate the case that the health tests
are disabled, because e.g. fips_enabled is unset. Make the stub
health_test_process() return this value for now.

As long as the statistical tests need more input noise samples before
reaching a conclusion, health_queue will get returned from
health_test_process(). FWIW, the number of successive input samples needed
by the tests will be at the order of 128 to 8192, depending on the per-IRQ
entropy estimate. add_interrupt_randomness() currently attempts to transfer
the noise kept within in the per-CPU fast_pool, which is of limited
capacity, to the global input_pool as soon as a threshold of 64 events is
reached and it will continue to do so. However, as long as some tests are
pending, i.e. keep returning health_queue, the associated amount of
estimated entropy must not get added to the global input_pool balance, but
queued up at the fast_pool's queued_entropy instance. Once the health test
have eventually succeeded, as indiciated by health_test_process(), the
entropy previously queued up may get dispatched to the global reserve.
OTOH, on test failure health_discard will get returned and all entropy
queued up from add_interrupt_randomness() since the last dispatch (or
discard resp.) must get discarded.

Note that add_interrupt_randomness() will continue to unconditionally mix
the samples into the fast_pools and eventually into the global input_pool
-- the health test results really only affect the entropy accounting.

So, make add_interrupt_randomness() invoke health_test_process() on
the current cycle counter value in case fips_enabled is set.

In case a fast_pool's fill level threshold of 64 events is reached at a
time when health tests are still pending and keep returning health_queue,
let add_interrupt_randomness() continue to mix the fast_pool's contents
into the input_pool as before, but enqueue the associated amount of entropy
at the fast_pool's associated queued_entropy instance for later dispatch.

Both, entropy dispatch as well as discard operations, require a call to
__dequeue_entropy(), which in turn must only get invoked with the
input_pool's ->lock being held. It follows that in case the spin_trylock()
in add_interrupt_randomness() failed, the latter would not be able to
perform entropy dispatch or discard operations immediately at the time
those have been requested by the health tests. Add two new boolean flags,
->dispatch_needed and ->discard_needed, to struct fast_pool. Set them from
add_interrupt_randomness() in case health_test_process() returned
health_dispatch or health_discard resp.. Make the current and subsequent
add_interrupt_randomness() invocations to check for ->dispatch_needed and
->discard_needed and to attempt to execute any pending dispatch/discard
request. Clear ->dispatch_needed and ->discard_needed again when the
prerequisite ->lock could eventually be obtained.

As actual health tests returning anything but health_none haven't been
implemented yet, there is no behavioural change at this point.
