What is the benefit of that change?

This series also goes way beyond that, so it seems like there's more going on
here.  I do like the support for vaddr; the scatterlist-based APIs have always
been one of the main pain points with the crypto API.  But you're claiming
that fixing that isn't actually the goal.  So I'm confused.

dm-verity usually hashes 4K at a time, but that was enough for people to want it
to support hardware accelerators, so it had to be switched to ahash.  But, you
objected to my patch that added shash support to dm-verity alongside ahash
(https://lore.kernel.org/dm-devel/20231030023351.6041-1-ebiggers@kernel.org).

That suggests that adding lskcipher support to dm-crypt and fscrypt alongside
skcipher would similarly not be "allowed".  Most users don't use off-CPU
hardware accelerators with those, but some do.

I did get away with (so far) switching fs/verity/ to shash.  I'm not sure I
could similarly get away with switching fs/crypto/ to lskcipher.  There are
people using the CAAM AES-CBC hardware accelerator with fscrypt.

Before we go through a big effort to convert all these algorithms to lskcipher,
or (more likely based on history) leave everything in a half-finished state, I'd
like to get a good sense that lskcipher will be useful.
