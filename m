Ok, let me summarize the status and what I think we will need to do in cifs.

DES
---
Removal of DES is not controversial since this only affects SMB1.
SMB2 has been around since 2006 and it is starting to become viable to at least
disable the SMB1 protocol by default today.
There are still servers that only support SMB1 but they are becoming rare.
I think also Microsoft Windows default to disable (but not remove)
SMB1 by default
on some configurations today.

I am proposing that we remove the hard dependency to DES and instead
make it a soft dependency to "do not build SMB1 if DES is missing".

MD4/MD5/ARC4
----------------------
These are all used together in NTLMSSP authentication today, including
in the very latest
versions of the protocol. This is the only authentication mechanism
available in cifs
aside from the "extended" kerberos 5 protocol that ActiveDirectory implements.
As such the vast majority of clients rely on this when accessing SMB servers.

ARC4 is technically possible to remove since it is only used in the
final stage for KEY_EXCHANGE
when negotiating the session key. It could be removed but it would
make NTLMSSP weaker.
But if we have to move other crypto into fs/cifs anyway we can just as
well copy ARC4 into fs/cifs.

MD4 is used to create a hash, which is then one of the inputs into
MD5-HMAC for the core part of the
NTLMSSP authentication so we would need private versions of at least
md4 to be copied to fs/cifs as well.

I am proposing that we fork both ARC4 and MD4 and host private
versions of these in fs/cifs.


I have patches for both DES removal and forking ARC4 prepared for linux-cifs.
MD4 will require more work since we use it via the crypto_alloc_hash()
api but we will do that too.

What about MD5? Is it also scheduled for removal? if so we will need
to fork it too.
