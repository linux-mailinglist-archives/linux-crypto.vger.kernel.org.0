As I mentioned in my next reply I'm actually leaning towards slice-by-1 only
now.

Yes, though I doubt that anyone who was selecting a specific generic CRC32
implementation really put much thought into it.  And if we standardize on one
implementation then the choice will go away and it won't matter anyway.
