As I said at
https://lore.kernel.org/dm-devel/20250116080324.GA3910@sol.localdomain/, shash
could fairly easily be fixed to support sleepable algorithms (e.g.
CRYPTO_ALG_SLEEPABLE).

This would be *much* simpler than doing it with ahash.

You even had it as a shash already in the first version of your patchset, just
missing the bits that add the support for sleepable algorithms.

I am trying to help you by suggesting an approach that would be much easier.
There is no need to shoehorn CPU-based crypto into ahash, which is designed for
off-CPU offload.

I.e. it already uses a kernel thread that does the operation synchronously (as
opposed to being actual hardware offload that does not consume a thread and
signals completion to the CPU via an interrupt), in addition to the caller's
thread which also waits synchronously via crypto_wait_req().  There is really no
need to make it async, nor to use scatterlists.
