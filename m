 I am not going to mitigate these. We will never format new devices
using these exotic configurations. And if user enforces it, there can be
a reason - or it is just stupid, like using cipher_null.
(Which is entirely insecure but very useful for testing.)

The IV concept in dm-crypt is straightforward and allows many insecure
and obscure combinations (aes-ecb-null, for example - and this is used
for millions of chipset encrypted drivers, people used it to access through
dmcrypt without the USB bridge.) The same applies for obscure cryptloop
image combinations. (I would better spent time to remove cryptoloop,
it is much worse that what we are discussing here :)

So I see no reason to spend hours and hours attacks for devices
that use crypto that is obsolete anyway (all new drives use XTS).

I would like to provide way to access data on existing, maybe obsolete and insecure,
encrypted images from foreign OSes.

But all that said is meant in the isolated context of dm-crypt driver,
if you want to provide generic API, it perhaps makes sense to enforce such a policy.

I understand you want to propose more secure ways of implementing crypto,
but then - if you decide to remove existing API I used, we can switch to something better.
(Is there something better except AES-only lib you used?)

I just disagree with adding various checks for cipher/mode/iv combinations inside dm-crypt.
It was meant to be configurable from userspace.
