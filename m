Looks okay, but the comment isn't great since it doesn't get to the point until
the last sentence.  Also it talks about an exported symbol, which is confusing
because shash_no_setkey won't actually be exported anymore.  I'd prefer
something like the following:

/*
 * Check whether an shash algorithm has a setkey function.
 *
 * For CFI compatibility, this must not be an inline function.  This is because
 * when CFI is enabled, modules won't get the same address for shash_no_setkey
 * (if it were exported, which inlining would require) as the core kernel will.
 */
bool crypto_shash_alg_has_setkey(struct shash_alg *alg)
{
        return alg->setkey != shash_no_setkey;
}
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(crypto_shash_alg_has_setkey);
