If this is the motivation, then maybe it should be presented as the motivation?
Let's look at the patchset itself:

    "Add support for Texas Instruments DTHE V2 crypto accelerator"

    "This series adds support for TI DTHE V2 crypto accelerator. DTHE V2 is a
    new crypto accelerator which contains multiple crypto IPs [1].  This series
    implements support for ECB and CBC modes of AES for the AES Engine of the
    DTHE, using skcipher APIs of the kernel."

    config CRYPTO_DEV_TI_DTHEV2
        tristate "Support for TI DTHE V2 crypto accelerators"
        depends on CRYPTO && CRYPTO_HW && ARCH_K3
        select CRYPTO_ENGINE
        select CRYPTO_SKCIPHER
        select CRYPTO_ECB
        select CRYPTO_CBC
        help
          This enables support for the TI DTHE V2 hw crypto accelerator
          which can be found on TI K3 SOCs. Selecting this enables use
          of hardware acceleration for cryptographic algorithms on
          these devices.

Nothing about side channel resistance, but everything about it being an
"accelerator" and providing "hardware acceleration".  That implies that
performance is the primary motivation.

(Also, nothing about any actual use case like dm-crypt...)

If your crypto engine does indeed provide additional side channel resistance
beyond that of ARMv8 CE, and you have an actual use case where that provides a
meaningful benefit, that's potentially valuable.

Of course, it has to be weighed against the fact that these sorts of crypto
engines are problematic in pretty much every other way.  Besides actually being
slower than the CPU, they also they often have bugs/issues where they produce
the wrong output or corrupt data.  Getting those things right should be the
first priority.  Yes, you'll vouch for your driver, but so does everyone else,
and yet they actually still have these issues.  Unfortunately the odds are kind
of stacked against you; these drivers are really hard to get right.  And the
crypto self-tests don't even properly test them.

As I mentioned, these drivers also exacerbate the usual issues we have with
kernel security, where userspace programs can exploit kernel bugs to escalate
privileges.  This is because they're all accessible to userspace via AF_ALG.

Anyway, if this is supported at all, it should be opt-in at runtime.  So yes,
please decrease the cra_priority that you're registering the algorithms with.

> I can use crypto accelerator and save CPU for other activities

For the small message sizes that get used in practice this doesn't seem very
plausible, especially when the alternative is ARMv8 CE.  The driver overhead and
scheduling overhead is just too much on small message sizes.

I'm afraid 'cryptsetup benchmark --cipher aes-cbc' is not at all the right
benchmark to use here, and it's quite misleading here:

- 'cryptsetup benchmark' uses a 64 KiB message size by default.  That's 16 times
  longer than the messages that dm-crypt typically uses.  The longer messages
  strongly skew the numbers towards the hardware crypto engine.

- 'cryptsetup benchmark' uses AF_ALG and measures not just the crypto
  performance but also the overhead of AF_ALG.  This has the effect of
  diminishing any difference in speeds.  The real difference is larger.

- You benchmarked AES-CBC, which is outdated for storage encryption.  AES-XTS is
  generally the better choice, and it's faster than AES-CBC on the CPU.
  Presumably you chose AES-CBC because your driver does not support AES-XTS.

With an 833 MHz CPU, I don't think you'll see 50x worse like I saw on some other
boards.  However, the real difference will be more than the 2x worse you're
seeing with 'cryptsetup benchmark --cipher aes-cbc'.  A more accurate benchmark
would be to do an in-kernel benchmark with 4 KiB messages, of AES-XTS (ARMv8 CE)
vs either AES-CBC-ESSIV with the AES-CBC component offloaded to your crypto
engine or AES-XTS with the AES-ECB component offloaded.
