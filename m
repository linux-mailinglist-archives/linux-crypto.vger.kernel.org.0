RFC7519 is TLS Specific.
I do not know if short-exponents are safe to use in all use cases.

If it is safe, your choice is fine and your arguments will follow, but
then a comment that explains the choice and warns about key checks if
it is changed would be a good idea.

Otherwise the default should be to use N = len(q), which implies the
proper checks need to be applied.

Simo.
