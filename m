We should still just get rid of that, since equivalent functionality is
available in software, is better tested, and isn't performance-critical.

What is the actual point of this?  The NIST DRBGs are already seeded from
random.c, which is sufficient by itself but doesn't play well with
certifications, and from Jitterentropy which the certification side is happy
with.  And the NIST DRBGs are only present for certification purposes anyway;
all real users use random.c instead.  So what problem still needs to be solved?

This doesn't need to be configurable, and shouldn't be; just choose an
appropriate hash.

It would be better to standardize on one way of doing it so that people can't
choose the wrong way.

random.c is already NUMA-optimized.

random.c already supports atomic operations.
