If I understand Andy's concern it is the observation that the weakest
link in this facility is the initial key load. Yes, KL reduces
exposure after that event, but the key loading process is still
vulnerable. This question is similar to the concern between the Linux
"encrypted-keys" and "trusted-keys" interface. The trusted-keys
interface still has an attack window where the key is unwrapped in
kernel space to decrypt the sub-keys, but that exposure need not cross
the user-kernel boundary and can be time-limited to a given PCR state.
The encrypted-keys interface maintains the private-key material
outside the kernel where it has increased exposure. KL is effectively
"encrypted-keys" and Andy is questioning whether this makes KL similar
to the MKTME vs SGX / TDX situation.

I don't think this answers Andy's question. There is a distinction
between what it can be used for and what people will deploy with it in
practice given the "encrypted-keys"-like exposure. Clarify the end
user benefit that motivates the kernel to carry this support.
