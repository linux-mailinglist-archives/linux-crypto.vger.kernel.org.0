On my machine the performance difference on a 1472-byte request
between SIMD and generic is 2161 vs. 7558 (cycles).

What if the same machine was doing TLS/IPsec sends at full throttle?
That would be exactly the wrong time to slow down softirqs four-fold,
no?

I don't have an issue your patch per se.  But please make it so that
it has the async path like everything else.  Also wireless uses shash
so it can't use an ahash anyway even if it is sync.
