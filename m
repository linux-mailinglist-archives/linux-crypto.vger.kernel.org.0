Replying to self again - apologies.

I think this is actually correct after all: synchronize_rcu_tasks()
guarantees that all tasks have passed through a 'safe state', i.e.,
voluntary schedule(), return to userland, etc, which guarantees that
no task could be executing the old static call target after
synchronize_rcu_tasks() returns.
