If SVA isn't supported, having VA == IOVA looks nice but isn't
particularly useful. We could instead require that, if SVA isn't
supported, userspace handles VA and IOVA separately for any DMA region.

Enforcing VA == IOVA adds some unnecessary complexity to this module. In
addition to the special case for software MSIs that is already there
(uacce_iommu_has_sw_msi), it's also not guaranteed that the whole VA space
is representable with IOVAs, you might need to poke holes in the IOVA
space for reserved regions (See iommu.*resv). For example VFIO checks that
the IOVA requested by userspace doesn't fall into a reserved range (see
iova_list in vfio_iommu_type1.c). It also exports to userspace a list of
possible IOVAs through VFIO_IOMMU_GET_INFO.

Letting the DMA API allocate addresses would be simpler, since it already
deals with resv regions and software MSI.

VFIO needs to let userspace pick its IOVA, because the IOVA space is
generally managed by a guest OS. In my opinion this is a baggage that
uacce doesn't need.

If we only supported the DMA API and not unmanaged IOMMU domains,
userspace would need to do a little bit more work by differentiating
between VA and DMA addresses, but that could be abstracted into the uacce
library and it would make the kernel module a lot simpler.

Yes, you do need PASID support for auxiliary domains, but not PRI/Stall.

As above, it's probably worth exploring this method further for !SVA.

Yes but dma_alloc_coherent() creates the IOMMU mapping, and
uacce_queue_map_qfr()'s only task is to create the IOMMU mapping when the
DMA API isn't in use, so you could move this call up, right after
uacce_qfr_alloc_pages().

I think the only way to fix that problem is to avoid reallocating the
resources until they are released, because we can't count on userspace to
always call the PUT_Q ioctl. Sometimes the program will crash before that.

By the way, lockdep detects a possible unsafe locking scenario here,
because we're taking the uacce_mutex even though mmap called us with the
mmap_sem held for writing. Conversely uacce_fops_release() takes the
mmap_sem for writing while holding the uacce_mutex. I think it can be
fixed easily, if we simply remove the use of mmap_sem in
uacce_fops_release(), since it's only taken to do some accounting which
doesn't look right.

However, a similar but more complex locking issue comes from the current
use of iommu_sva_bind/unbind_device():

uacce_fops_open:
 iommu_sva_unbind_device()
  iommu_sva_bind_group()	[iommu_group->mutex]
    mmu_notifier_get()		[mmap_sem]

uacce_fops_mmap:		[mmap_sem]
				[uacce_mutex]

uacce_fops_release:
				[uacce_mutex]
  iommu_sva_unbind_device()	[iommu_group->mutex]

This circular dependency can be broken by calling iommu_sva_unbind_device()
outside of uacce_mutex, but I think it's worth reworking the queue locking
scheme a little and use fine-grained locking for the queue state.

Something else I noticed is uacce_idr isn't currently protected. The IDR
API expected the caller to use its own locking scheme. You could replace
it with an xarray, which I think is preferred to IDR now and provides a
xa_lock.

Thanks,
Jean
