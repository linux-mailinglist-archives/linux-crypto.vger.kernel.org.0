So I think we just got blocked on not knowing if turning on vector 
everywhere in the kernel was a good idea -- it's not what any other port 
does despite there having been some discussions floating around, but we 
never really figured out why.  I can come up with some possible 
performance pathologies related to having vector on in many contexts, 
but it's all theory as there's not really any vector hardware that works 
upstream (though the K230 is starting to come along, so maybe that'll 
sort itself out).

Last we talked I think the general consensus is that we'd waited long 
enough, if nobody has a concrete objection we should just take it and 
see -- sure maybe there's some possible issues, but anything could have 
issues.

I'm fine with that sort of approach too, it's certainly more in line 
with other ports to just restrict the kernel-mode vector support to 
explicitly enabled sections.  Sure maybe there's other stuff to do in 
kernel vector land, but we can at least get something going.

> Andy, what do you think?

I'll wait on Andy to see, but I generally agree we should merge 
something for this cycle.

Andy: maybe just send a patch set with what you think is the best way to 
go?  Then we have one target approach and we can get things moving.
