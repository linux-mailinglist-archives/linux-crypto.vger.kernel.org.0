For the purpose of identifying FIPS-disabled algorithm (as opposed
to an algorithm that's not enabled in the kernel at all), I think
it is perfectly safe to use ELIBBAD instead of ENOENT in user-space.

Remember that ELIBBAD means that every kernel implementation of
the given algorithm has failed.  Since we would never allow a
generic algorithm to be merged into the kernel unless it passed
its own self-test, this is extremely unlikely unless the algorithm
has been disabled by FIPS.
