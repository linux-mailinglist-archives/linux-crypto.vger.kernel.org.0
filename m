I still don't really understand what you want. First you said this was
a problem and we should reintroduce the old behavior. Then you said no
big deal and the docs just needed to be updated. Now you're saying
this is a problem and we should reintroduce the old behavior?

I'm just a bit lost on where we were in the conversation.

Also, could you let me know whether this is affecting real things for
Huawei, or if this is just something you happened to notice but
doesn't have any practical impact?

Jason
