I didn't mean to imply that you don't know your stuff :-) I am just
reiterating the EBOIV issue so we can compare it to the issue you are
bringing up

The tweak encryption uses a dedicated key, so leaking it does not have
the same impact as it does in the EBOIV case. And a plaintext attack
on the data encryption part of XTS involves knowing the value of the
tweak as well, so you'd have to successfully attack the tweak before
you can attack the data. So while your point is valid, it's definitely
less broken than EBOIV.

Due to the asynchronous nature of the driver, we'll usually be calling
into the OS scheduler after queuing one or perhaps several blocks for
processing by the hardware. Even if the processing time is fixed, the
time it takes for the OS to respond to the completion IRQ and process
the output is unlikely to correlate the way a table based software
implementation does, especially if several blocks can be in flight at
the same time.

But note that we are basically in agreement here: falling back to
table based AES is undesirable, but for EBOIV it is just much worse
than for other modes.

If you can find a truly time-invariant C implementation of AES that
isn't orders of magnitude slower than aes-generic, I'm sure we can
merge it.

We all do. But we all have different use cases to worry about, and
different experiences and backgrounds :-)

The main problem is that banning aes-generic is a bit too rigorous
imo. It highly depends on whether there is known plaintext and whether
there are observable latencies in the first place.
